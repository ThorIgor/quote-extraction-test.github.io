<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Join Columbia's Harriman Institute for a talk with Nikolay Sarkisyan about the results of his PhD project on the formation, implementation and decline of the politics of tolerance in Russia in the 2000s and 2010s. In his research, he argues that the politics of tolerance became possible because the Kremlin, seeking legitimacy in the eyes of the international community, adopted the ideology of tolerance to handle societal diversity.<br>Sarkisyan examines governmental measures to promote tolerance—from legislation to work routines of the bureaucracy—and concludes that they proceeded in a ritualistic manner. In the 2000s, the idea of tolerance was reduced to being instrumental for nation-building as a part of the strengthening the state. Immediate implementers had little understanding of what they were doing and why. The politics never implied the tolerance towards LGBTQI+ community. It became a target for attacks and a reason to abandon the term tolerance altogether. This talk suggests that the entire enterprise of the politics of tolerance was an ideological imitation that crumbled when confronted with domestic politics objectives and peculiarities of the governance.<br>Nikolay Sarkisyan, PhD candidate, University of Oslo</div>

<br>Publicly at least, Russia was the bad guy in Munich, roundly criticized for interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign after the U.S. indictment of 13 Russians this week, and more broadly for its 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea.<br>For the West, such unity of purpose marked a change after a year of Trump’s “America First” rhetoric, his inconsistent statements on NATO and the European Union, his decision to pull out of the Paris climate change accord and his move not to certify Iran’s compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.<br>At the annual Munich event, a rare gathering of European and U.S. security officials that also attracts top Russian diplomats, American policymakers were visibly irritated with Moscow’s public denials of accusations of meddling.<br>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">It’s called a “mirror site,” and the concept is simple: Lure people into thinking they’re visiting a website such as ours at Hudson Institute by copying the basic look and features. Then try to get visitors to reveal personal information or embed their computers with malware.<br>Microsoft alerted us and another policy organization, the International Republican Institute, Sunday that they had saved us from a cyberattack by a hacking group known as Fancy Bear, which is thought to be a creation of Russian intelligence. Fortunately, the company detected the attack before anyone was duped. Using existing legal authority to shutter such sites, Microsoft quickly took the impostors down.<br>This isn’t the first time a foreign government or affiliated entity has launched a cyberattack against us. Sadly, it won’t be the last. Everyone here at Hudson has been trained to be on the lookout for spear-phishing and other attacks. The public at large, however, isn’t so lucky. They remain highly vulnerable to email that looks legitimate but isn’t.<br>According to law-enforcement officials, it was a Russian spear-phishing exercise that pried open thousands of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta while he served as Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman.<br>Even when unsuccessful, these attacks—by Russian, Chinese, Iranian and North Korean intelligence services and their formal or informal networks of hackers—impose a cost on those targeted. They are a drain on staff and administrative resources and can have a chilling effect on your work, even when Microsoft has your back, as in our case.<br>Most such attacks are geared to gain access to bank accounts. Fancy Bear seems to have other purposes in mind.<br>My Hudson colleagues and I have been outspoken on the numerous challenges Russia presents to U.S. national interests and international security: its illegal annexation of Crimea, continuing incursion in eastern Ukraine, support of Bashar Assad’s brutal dictatorship in Syria, electoral interference in the U.S. and other democracies, targeting of U.S. diplomats, attempted assassinations in the U.K. and Ukraine, increasing repression at home. President Vladimir Putin seems to be relishing the role of international troublemaker. My colleagues have been promoting tough-minded policies in all these areas and others.<br>We are especially proud of our Kleptocracy Initiative, which has exposed how Mr. Putin and his cronies in the Kremlin and Eastern Europe launder their ill-gotten money through shell companies and offshore accounts in Western jurisdictions. We will continue working to make sure kleptocrats can’t use their wealth to undermine Western democracy.<br>If Fancy Bear’s intention is to embarrass or intimidate us, it won’t work. Hudson fellows will continue to speak their minds on public-policy matters.<br>In these highly charged partisan times, however, some are getting a little ahead of the facts as they search for the motive behind the latest attacks. In a front page report, the New York Times suggested that Hudson was targeted because of opposition among our fellows to President Trump’s desire for improved relations with Russia.<br>This claim is misleading at many levels. In the first place, in my view and that of many of my colleagues, the Trump administration has rightly adopted aggressive policies to address the renewed threat Russia poses to U.S. national interests, to European and other allies, and to regional stability.<br>Most notably, the administration has increased spending on the European Reassurance Initiative deterrent by 40%, offered lethal-weapon assistance to Ukraine, expelled 60 Russian diplomats from the U.S. in response to the Skripal poisonings in the U.K., and imposed far tougher sanctions on Russia than any European partners have.<br>The Trump administration has pursued a far more aggressive campaign against Russian malign influence than has the European Union—imposing not only broad economic sanctions, but also measures against dozens of oligarchs close to the Kremlin.<br>Just this month, the Trump administration announced additional sanctions that ban American companies from exporting any equipment to Russia with a national-security purpose.<br>At Hudson Institute we have proudly worked with our friends in the administration to promote American national security, and will continue to do so.<br>Relations with Russia can improve—when Russian behavior improves. The U.S. ought to be able to have honest and forthright discussions with Russia about matters of mutual interest, from nuclear weapons and proliferation to terrorism. Conversations on such matters took place even at the height of the Cold War. Today, however, Mr. Putin seems intent on playing a different game.<br>Hudson stands for bold U.S. leadership in these increasingly dangerous times. Fancy Bear can get stuffed.</div>

 citing Denikin’s memoirs.<br>OK, Ukrainians have gotten used to this predatory intolerance from their eastern neighbor, and unlike in 1918 when the first modern attempt to establish an independent Ukraine was made but was not strong enough to succeed, today’s Ukraine has proudly affirmed its independence for 30 years.<br>For more than seven years, Ukraine has also managed to hold back on the battlefield the military might of a resurgent imperialist Russia, even at the cost of temporarily losing control of Crimea and part of eastern Ukraine.<br>For there is another crucial element that Putin and his imperialist gurus seem to miss entirely, and which exposes how obsolete their thinking is.<br>We are not living in the 19th century. Today’s democratic European Ukraine has since the defining programmatic contribution of its initial champions, the Rukh democratic coalition which emerged in the late 1980s, been built around the idea of a Ukrainian political nation, not ethnocentrism.<br>Russia, therefore, represents a different, hostile, civilizational model of an autocratic self-extolling system resting on its totalitarian foundations. Its selective rewriting and interpretation of history as dictated from the top is but one of the hallmarks.<br>That’s why ethnic Russians, Jews, Poles, and others who support what modern post-Soviet Ukraine represents, be they Ukrainian or Russia-speakers, are patriots and defend Ukraine’s independence, and support those who genuinely want the freedom to reach Russia and Belarus as well.<br>And that’s why, so many Russian speakers, ethnic Russian, and members of Ukraine’s national minorities were present at the Maidan and since then have been on the eastern front defending Ukraine against Russian aggression.<br>For Ukrainians, in this contemporary, inclusive, sense as loyal citizens, are simultaneously opposing Russian military aggression, and at the same time defending their civilizational choice – to be with the free world, not the autocratic Eurasian one.<br>The problem perpetuated by Putin’s chauvinist stance is course, deeper than any possible impact on Ukraine and Ukrainians, which will be largely negligible. It also says nothing new to his domestic audience steeped in this cheap Russian egocentrism, bullying and bravado – read political complacency, corruption and implicit warmongering.<br>It’s the impact that such traditional Russian narratives, built on disinformation, continue to have on the ignorant, naïve or Russophiles in the Western World, that is more disconcerting.<br>On those ever ready to swallow the Russo-centric presentation of Russia’s history, culture and today’s realities, and to appease or walk away leaving Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and Georgia to deal with a nineteenth-century holdover of an imperialist predator masking itself as a misunderstood, and victimized military colossus. One which, in any case, we should do business with.<br>Let’s recall what that great Russian democrat Andrei Sakharov warned us about in 1973, in terms that are applicable to today’s situation with Putin’s Russia.<br>Speaking in 1973, Sakharov rejected

<br>Soviet then and tsarist before it, Putin’s Russia today wants us to forget real history (just look at its revisionist treatment of Stalin, World War II, etc.) and accept the version that its current ideological custodians offer as a substitute for the truth. It’s up to all of us to ensure that this crude tactic inherited from the tsars, and refined in the Soviet era, is seen for what it is and returned to the sender with a boomerang effect.</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Join Columbia's Harriman Institute for a lecture exploring the complexities of countering hybrid warfare in Ukraine without limiting freedom of speech.<br>Within the past few years, the Ukrainian authorities have been heavily criticized by international watchdogs and independent observers for some legal steps and practical policies that allegedly curtail freedom of speech and access to information in the country. The government and its supporters argue, however, that the policies are justified by the actual situation of war waged by the neighboring Russia against Ukraine and have nothing to do with a censorship in a conventional sense but, rather, represents a defensive measure against the enemy’s propaganda, subversion, and provocative disinformation. The debate represents a particular case of a broader controversy between the demand for unrestrained freedom of speech indispensable for modern democracy and the need of those very democracies to protect themselves from the rogue individuals, groups, and regimes that increasingly learned how to weaponize media and (dis)information for their malevolent goals.<br>Mykola Riabchuk, Senior Research Fellow in the Institute of Political and Nationalities’ Studies at the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">DER SPIEGEL: Your Open Russia movement has been championing his cause. What exactly have you been doing?<br>Khodorkovsky: We actively supported the rallies in Moscow for Sentsov. For the opening of the World Cup, our people hung a large picture of him next to Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium, but it was immediately torn down again.<br>DER SPIEGEL: You were once considered Russia's richest man and you know many Russian billionaires who have been personally affected by Western sanctions. Are the sanctions hitting the right people?<br>Khodorkovsky: I wouldn't presume to say whether the right people are being hit from the perspective of Western countries. I don't even know why these people were targeted -- the reasons weren't made public. I think that is a mistake.<br>DER SPIEGEL: What effect do the sanctions have on Russia's wealthy?<br>Khodorkovsky: Take a man like Gennady Timchenko, who has a house in Geneva, or Igor Sechin, who has an 80-meter (262-foot) yacht in the Mediterranean. Of course, it's a loss if they are no longer able to use these things. But when Putin is no longer in power, they will lose everything. What is more important to them? Nobody will seek to topple Putin just because they are no longer allowed to travel to the Bavarian Alps.<br>DER SPIEGEL: You're trying to influence Russian political developments through a foundation. Which young politicians do you consider to be especially promising?<br>Khodorkovsky: The best-known are, in descending order: Alexei Navalny , the left-wing politician Sergei Udaltsov, Yevgeny Roizman, the former mayor of Yekaterinburg, ex-Duma deputy Dmitry Gudkov...<br>DER SPIEGEL: ... and Ksenia Sobchak, the society reporter who was permitted to run in the last election as Putin's challenger? Many view her as being a puppet of the Kremlin.<br>Khodorkovsky: Sobchak plays the game the Kremlin allows her to play in politics. But that also applies to all politicians in Russia. Anyone who crosses the lines set for them will wind up in prison. Ksenia Sobchak asked for my support before the election. I asked her: Can you guarantee that you will not abandon your political involvement afterward? That you will devote all your time to politics?

 they need to look for a different movement.<br>DER SPIEGEL: Navalny, in particular, has been accused of not tolerating any competition.<br>Khodorkovsky: Navalny's model is that of the leader. I know that is consistent with the mentality in today's Russia. He promises to ensure a more democratic form of government if he gets elected. But I think it would end in a new authoritarianism. I have also said that to Navalny. I support him as one of the politicians that a future Russia needs, but not as the sole savior who leads us to democracy. We don't need a benevolent czar, no matter what his name may be.<br>DER SPIEGEL: Are you satisfied with the results delivered by your political movement?<br>Khodorkovsky: It's hard to be totally satisfied. If we look at Russia today, there are two independent movements within the democratic spectrum. One is that of Navalny's people, and the other is Open Russia. Everyone else is in decline, even the left-liberal Yabloko Party. It is important for a democratic Russia that there is not just one opposition structure, but two. But only when there are three, or better yet four, will I be confident that we we won't end up in a new authoritarianism after a regime change.<br>DER SPIEGEL: You aren't the first rich Russian to have confronted Putin and fought from abroad for a change in government. The late oligarch Boris Berezovsky did the same. What differentiates you from him?<br>Khodorkovsky: Berezovsky saw himself as the man who had brought Putin to power and was then betrayed by Putin. He wanted to create trouble for Putin, not to democratize Russia. My aim is not the overthrow of the president, but the establishment of parliamentary democracy. If Putin is prepared tomorrow to democratize the country himself, then I'm all for it.<br>DER SPIEGEL: Do you expect changes in the next few years, even before the end of Putin's term of office in 2024?<br>Khodorkovsky: Realistically speaking, little is likely to change. But I do believe Putin is capable of change, even if the odds are slim.<br>DER SPIEGEL: What do you think of former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's involvement in Russia ? He's also now on the supervisory board of Rosneft, the oil company of Putin's confidant Igor Sechin.<br>Khodorkovsky: I do not approve of Schröder's behavior, but I do understand it. Putin helped him adopt two children, so he feels a deep sense of personal gratitude. The result being that he convinces himself that Putin is not as bad as everyone says. Putin has done a good job at this -- he's a professional when it comes to recruiting. Today, Schröder is a person who has no influence on Putin, but through him, Putin can influence a segment of German society.<br>DER SPIEGEL: What influence does Vladimir Putin have on Donald Trump? Do you think the Kremlin actually has any compromising material against him?<br>Khodorkovsky: I don't believe there is material of importance in Moscow. Trump is not the kind of man you could put in jeopardy with stories about women. And as far as financial ties with Russia are concerned, they would have to be at such a high level that the FBI would have noticed.<br>DER SPIEGEL: Maybe Putin and Trump are just soul mates ...<br>Khodorkovsky: I don't believe that either. To me, Trump is an extravagant businessman who wants to transfer his experience from the business world to the system of government. When inappropriate methods are transferred to a new object, a conflict arises -- and this is similar to the conflict that arises in Putin's system, where a mafioso group is trying to lead a country. Essentially, they are quite different. The similarities are purely on the surface.<br>DER SPIEGEL: Russia is in a difficult situation. In contrast to those imposed by the European Union, the U.S. Congress has ensured that American sanctions against Russia are very difficult to lift. What would you do if you were in government?<br>Khodorkovsky: I would say, I don't care about sanctions in the first place. I can export oil and gas anyway, and the West will not be able to do without them, so these revenues will still be mine. I would also take a calm view toward the ban on importing certain technologies. Russia is so economically ineffective that it is unable to use cutting-edge technology anyway. The slightly older models that we are still able to get suffice for our purposes. What would worry me is the lack of human potential. The most productive people are leaving the country and foreign experts are no longer coming. It's also a question of reputation.<br>DER SPIEGEL: Can the World Cup bring about change on that front?<br>Khodorkovsky: In this respect, the World Cup is important, even if it alone does not go far enough. I would also reform the institutions. The people I want to attract can have no impact unless there are independent courts and a parliament that does its work professionally. Reputation and the institutional environment are crucial. Sanctions are of secondary importance.<br>DER SPIEGEL: You had high hopes for Ukraine when the Euromaidan revolution prevailed there. Are you disappointed today in the face of sluggish reforms?<br>Khodorkovsky: I had hoped that Ukraine would become a model for Russian society. Unfortunately, Putin has succeeded in preventing this. And, unfortunately, some people in Ukraine helped him to do so -- out of greed. Other than that, though, I'm not disappointed. Ukraine is a large country, and no rapid changes could be expected. If the Ukrainians prevent a relapse into authoritarianism, the country will become a normal democracy after one or two changes of government. The economy will also recover.</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Of all the ridiculous claims made in the popular science press, one of the biggest is that we have discovered the possibility of alien life on some remote exoplanet.<br>The story usually goes like this: Astronomers find a star located many light-years away that hosts multiple planets. One of those planets is located in the &quot;Goldilocks Zone,&quot; the habitable region around a star. Upon closer examination, that planet appears to have gases in its atmosphere that might indicate life. The authors conclude that given the sheer number of these types of exoplanets, life could be everywhere in the universe.<br>Oh, that's just too good to resist. So, studies like that tend to lead to headlines like this:<br>The unexciting reality is that most exoplanets probably do not have life on them, but even if they do, they're too far away for us to unambiguously confirm it. Besides, if life on other planets resembles the evolution of life on our planet, then the most likely type of life we would encounter is microbial. That's a real bummer because microbes can't talk.<br>These statistical probabilities -- that nearby extraterrestrial life is unlikely and that the most common type of extraterrestrial life likely will be microbial -- essentially guarantees that aliens have never visited Earth. Yet, that doesn't stop the press from claiming that a three-fingered mummy in Peru is an alien.<br>No, the Three-Fingered Mummy in Peru Is Not an Alien<br>The London Evening Standard ran this headline:<br>The International Business Times (which is owned by Newsweek, so this makes more sense) ran this:<br>Extraterrestrial or bio-robots? At least IBT gave itself some wiggle room.<br>To their credit, some of the articles that covered this &quot;story&quot; (such as it is) reported that the &quot;scientist&quot; (such as he is) is controversial and that critics say the mummies are frauds.<br>Truthfully, no respectable news outlet should have covered this. The head researcher is Konstantin Korotkov, a well-known crank who once claimed to have photographed a soul leaving a human body. He is a hoaxer, so this is a non-story, just like &quot;Crazy Person on Street Keeps Yelling Crazy Things&quot; is also a non-story. Korotkov should have been ignored. But he wasn't.

 in the Western press.<br>Stop and think about that for a second. A complete hoax was circulated among Russian state-controlled media as legitimate news, and the Western media fell for it. Sure, some of them provided &quot;caveats,&quot; but the point is that Russian propaganda has so infiltrated the public discourse that it appears regularly in mainstream Western media outlets. That's shocking.<br>Why is Russia doing this? It appears that the Kremlin is waging a war on truth.

 demonstrated the multi-ethnic character of the Ukrainian nation. While Putin’s propagandists poisoned the international media with lies about xenophobic Ukrainian “Banderites” (right-wing xenophobes allegedly controlling the Ukrainian government), they could not deny the obvious: the Ukrainians were a multi-ethnic, internationalist force fighting for national liberation. Among those fighting for Ukraine were Orthodox Christians, Greek Catholics, Jews, Muslim Tatars and atheists. The war galvanized representatives of Ukrainian minorities, including Hungarians and Crimean Tatars, who helped the Ukrainian army, the refugees, or both. Jews in Ukraine also joined the resistance immediately and en masse. While outlining the role of the representatives of ethnic minorities in the Russian-Ukrainian war, the presentation will focus on the case studies representing about five thousand Ukrainian Jews who joined the troops, territorial defense, volunteer centers and army supply lines—in numbers much higher than the ratio of Jews to the general population.<br>Register here.</div>

Despite this interest, however, significant aspects of the conflict remain understudied and poorly understood. This report seeks to address one of these neglected areas by examining and contextualizing the involvement of people from Russia and the former Soviet Union. The report is divided into four parts—two looking at the contemporary situation and two identifying lessons from the evolution of conflict in the North Caucasus—and offers the following conclusions:<br>Click here to read the full report.<br>Cerwyn Moore is a CREST-funded researcher and a senior lecturer in International Relations, in the Department of Political Science and International Studies University of Birmingham.<br>Mark Youngman is an ESRC-funded doctoral student.<br>Photo by Qasioun News Agency shared under a CC BY 3.0 license.</div>

Dating from the times of the Helsinki process, which led to the founding of the OSCE, a favoured metaphor in Soviet and Russian thinking was the inclusive notion of

This space of sovereign states would include Russia as the largest among them – and the United States would be left on the margins or outside.<br>That chapter is closing now, as the Russian leadership abandons its own idea of inclusiveness.

As former Warsaw Pact countries and the previously Soviet Baltic republics have turned to the West, the EU has expanded East and now shares borders with Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. With the Ukraine war, Putin’s Russia also seems to have stopped wanting to be with Europe, because it feels its claim to remain a first-rate power has been disrespected, and that the absence of a show of force allowed its interests to be overlooked.<br>In effect, Russia has become the Anti-Europe, organised by geopolitical reasoning and bound by military power, and it seeks just one thing from the West: respect borne out of fear for the harm it could do. This Russia sees itself as entirely different from the EU in social and political norms, in its notion of a powerful and sovereign state, and in its view of its national identity and mission.<br>Moscow’s quest for status is focused on Washington. In Vladimir Putin’s world, Europe is second-class, troublesome but acquiescent.<br>Now, Moscow’s quest for status is focused on Washington. In Vladimir Putin’s world, Europe is second-class, troublesome but acquiescent. That some in Washington also look at Europe this way may help to reinforce his belief. However, the EU is something different: Europeans might have misread the geopolitical significance of its Eastern Partnership scheme in the eyes of the neo-Russians in the Kremlin, but they were not naïve about the transformative impact that could be effected by seemingly technical trade and association agreements. Obviously, Putin fears European soft power, since it is a force to which he has no response. Russia’s lack of attraction is one of its most serious weak spots. Its leverage rests on its state-controlled extracting industries and its military. The ideology of integration has become a new nationalism, which has as its core mission the resurrection of the Russian space.<br>Putin fears European soft power, since it is a force to which he has no response.<br>On Ukraine, EU leaders have chosen not to follow Putin’s shift from soft power to hard power. In political terms, their sanctions do not have as much effect on Putin’s Russia as they would have on a Russia that was seeking cooperation and trying to build a modern and competitive economy. To Moscow, Europe’s insistence on negotiations to end the fighting in Ukraine makes it look weak – indeed, it has allowed Russia to prevail in its attempt to neutralise Ukraine and prevent its departure to the West.<br>The EU is not pursuing an expansionist strategy and it will not wrest the country from Russia’s grip, but neither will it close the door on Ukraine or on any of its neighbours – not even on Russia. In the end, Putin will find that creating integration on Russian terms will have problematic implications. But for now, the consequences for those in Ukraine who would like to see their country integrated into EU and NATO are tragic. Russia may very well stop the process by way of militant separatism, and moreover, Ukraine’s economy, governance, and democracy are too weak to allow it to join the West.<br>Meanwhile, in its own house on the other side of the Kremlin’s dividing line, the EU will need to consolidate economic and social prosperity for all people under its roof, including the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians who must not be left marginalised and alienated in their home countries. To achieve this, Europe will need to integrate still further; it should rethink defence integration and instate more robust processes so that it can maintain a coherent foreign policy position. Ironically, Vladimir Putin could thus become an external federator of Europe – while his attempt to unite Eurasia could show up the real diversity of the actors within what he imagines as being the Russian space.</div>

Hard to argue with that, unfortunately.<br>Putin did not categorically deny that Russian intelligence services were responsible for the hacks on the DNC, rather, he stated that Russia does not have the kind of global media impact to seriously affect U.S. elections. When a question was put forward to him about whether cyberattacks should be banned from foreign elections, he quickly replied that cyber and any other means of foreign interference in elections should not be used.<br>Assuming that the consensus in the U.S. intelligence community is correct in its assessment that Russian intelligence organs have been responsible for some of the “leaks,&quot; how can we understand this development? My hunch is that this is a kind of signaling from the Kremlin to show off some capabilities to disrupt, but not necessarily alter, the outcome of the U.S. election. Vladimir Putin himself will be facing a re-election campaign in 2018, and I think he really does believe that the United States, and particularly a Hillary Clinton administration, would seek to interfere in the Russian elections to prevent Putin from being re-elected. Given the closed nature of the Russian political system, it seems hard to imagine how Washington could do so even if it wanted to, but I think this is Putin’s frame of reference.<br>The broader message Putin seemed to be signaling to the Valdai audience is that while deeply frustrated by U.S. policies which seemingly defy Russian interests, such as NATO enlargement, return to the ABM Treaty, or simply poorly judged engagements in Iraq, Libya, and Syria in his view (

 at the time, but more to the point, currently Russia finds itself surrounded by a number of neighbors with intermediate range missile capabilities that they continue to develop while the United States faces no such threat on the North American continent. If Moscow is reaching the conclusion that the INF agreement no longer meets Russian security interests, then perhaps they should simply withdraw as Washington did from the ABM Treaty nearly 15 years ago. While many would argue this would represent a further blow against arms control, perhaps it could clear the plate to open new discussions about conventional and nuclear negotiations in Europe and more broadly.<br>This was not the really angry Putin of 2014. Or the somewhat more forthcoming Putin of Valdai 2015, with the hope for cooperation with the United States in Syria and the global battle against terrorism. There was a lot of resignation on the part of Putin as well as Foreign Minister Lavrov about U.S.-Russian relations, but the message was that Moscow is open for business with Washington if the new administration is interested. Whether there will be much interest and whether the terms of engagement will be acceptable remains to be seen.<br>Andrew C.

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Mother Russia. The largest country in world, by area, is filled with allure, amazing biodiversity, rich history, and beautiful vodka-drinking women. It is also home to about 145 million people that comprise over 150 different ethnic groups, and at least 50 newspapers publish their voice in a language other than Russian. From 1283 to the present-day, Russia has slowly, steadily expanded its initial territory centered at Moscow east, west, north, and south. In 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville saw in Russia an alternative to the American democratic model that he observed firsthand in the conclusion of Volume 1 of his magnificent, two-volume book Democracy in America.

    “The American struggles against the natural obstacles which oppose him; the adversaries of the Russian are men; the former combats the wilderness and savage life; the latter, civilization with all its weapons and its arts: the conquests of the one are therefore gained by the ploughshare; those of the other by the sword. The Anglo-American relies upon personal interest to accomplish his ends, and gives free scope to the unguided exertions and common-sense of the citizens; the Russian centres all the authority of society in a single arm: the principal instrument of the former is freedom; of the latter servitude.”

<br>Indeed. All throughout the Cold War, de Tocqueville’s short paragraph comparing Russia with America was used as an introduction to essays comparing the two countries. The fact that it is again being used as an introduction to another essay on Russia serves as a harbinger of just how far these two countries have grown apart over the last decade and a half.<br>And yet, who among us would deny this insight, even in the first month of the year 2018? Who would describe Russia as a bastion of liberty today, save for those nationalists in the motherland who claim Moscow is only protecting ethnic Russians from oppressive regimes abroad?<br>Because Russia has been around for so long (the Grand Duchy of Moscow was founded in 1283), and because its territory stretches from the Baltic to the Pacific to the Arctic to the subtropical climates along the shore of the Black Sea, Russian battles have been numerous and far-flung. The following 10 battles fought by the Russian military can help to explain not only Russia’s long, illustrious, and bloody history, but also its relationships with current world players.<br>1. Battle of Aslanduz (October 1812). Russia and Persia (now Iran) have fought wars against each other since the mid 17th century, but the last important war was fought in the mid 19th century. Russo-Persian wars were bitter affairs fought mostly over the Caucasus, though religion was often used as the ideological justification for such wars. These wars outlasted plenty of dynasties on both sides of the mountainous border. The Battle of Aslanduz was a surprise attack led by Pyotr Kotlyarevsky, where 2,300 Russian soldiers ambushed 30,000 Persian troops at night and slaughtered them. The battle made Kotlyarevsky a celebrity back in Moscow, and forced the Persians to sue for peace. Today Russia and Persia still vie for influence in the Caucasus, though the Russians have the upper hand.<br>2. Siege of Izmail (December 22, 1789). Russia’s other main enemy in the Near East, the Ottoman Empire, also fought a number of wars with Moscow - over the course of four hundred years. Like the Persians, the Ottoman state was explicitly Muslim, so the Russians made good use of this fact in order to justify their wars in Eastern Europe against Istanbul. Izmail was a major Ottoman commercial city along the Danube River in what is now Ukraine, and it was heavily fortified with 40,000 Ottoman troops when the Russians attacked it from land and water. The siege was so successful that an unofficial national anthem (
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    “Let the Thunder of Victory Rumble!”

</mark>
) was composed in its honor.<br>3. Battle of Klushino (July 4, 1610). While the steady conquest of Persian and Ottoman lands went on slowly but surely through the late 18th to mid 19th centuries, the outcome was predictable given Russia’s technological and institutional superiority over the Sultans and Shahs. Moscow’s confidence was much shakier during its Baltic conquests nearly 200 years earlier. Russia, which found itself nestled up to the Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Swedish Empire, and for a time played a distant third fiddle to both powers in the Baltic Sea. The Battle of Klushino is illustrative of this, as less than 7,000 Polish cavalry crushed 35,000 Russian (and mercenary) troops. This battle cleared the way for a Polish aristocrat to enter Moscow unopposed as conqueror and liberator. Poland’s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier commemorates this battle, a testament to the peoples’ long history of violent interaction and mistrust.<br>4. Battle of Moscow (September 1 and 3, 1612). This battle saw Russians, organized into volunteer armies, liberate their capital city from foreign rule. When the Russian army lost to the Poles at Klushino, many Russian aristocrats actually decided to side with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and invited the Poles into Moscow to protect them from “anarchy.” Politics drove this battle more than anything else, but the narrative espoused by Russians plays to a distinct nationalist thread in Russian historiography. Volunteer armies, funded by Moscow’s merchants, fought Polish troops in the alleyways of Moscow and on her narrow streets, as the Poles tried to get provisions to their garrison stationed at the Kremlin. The volunteers held them off, thus forcing the Poles to choose between starvation or surrender (which they did on Nov. 7, 1612). This battle unofficially ended the Polish-Muscovy War, though officially hostilities didn’t end until 1618.<br>5. Battle of Poltava (July 8, 1709). Russia eventually succeeded in sedating Polish power in the Baltics, but Sweden was a continental Great Power and thus did not go easily into the night. For centuries Moscow and Stockholm clashed for supremacy in the Baltics, but it wasn’t until the Battle of Poltava that Russia finally landed a knockout blow. Fought during the Great Northern War (1700-1721), where everyone from Poland to Denmark-Norway to Great Britain to Prussia to the Netherlands to the Ottoman Empire participated, Peter the Great’s Russian army overpowered Sweden’s much smaller invading army at Poltava, using 40,000 troops to attack the 16,000 troops Sweden had marshaled for an offensive aimed at Russia’s beating heart: Moscow. Instead, Russia smashed Sweden, forcing the remnants of its army into the woods to be pursued and hounded until finally surrendering on July 11, 1709, a mere 10 days after the initial Swedish assault. Russia emerged as the clear victor of the 20-year war for the north, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br>6. The many battles for Albazin (17th century). Albazin was a fort along the Amur River, which is today part of the long border between Russia and China, that was built in the 17th century in order to bolster attempts by the Russians to colonize the area. Throughout the 17th century, Chinese armies repeatedly attacked and razed the fort, only to have to return again and again to do the same thing. This process, reminiscent of frontier tactics elsewhere in the world, played out for decades. In 1689, Russia signed its first treaty with China (“Treaty of Nerchinsk”) in large part because of its failed attempts at colonization through Albazin. It wasn’t until the humiliating Convention of Peking that Russia fully, officially acquired its Far Eastern territory stretching to the Pacific Rim city of Vladivostok. The battles for Albazin help to clarify the ambivalent nature of Sino-Russian relations. Sure, they’re suspicious neighbors, but they’ve got plenty of frontier between their metropoles.<br>7. Siege and Capture of Khiva (June 10, 1873). Khanate of Khiva was still a hotbed of slavery in 1873, and it was known particularly as place where slaves of Russian Orthodox stock were brought, bought, and sold. This gave Russia the perfect excuse to expand its empire into Central Asia. Slavery was also a big moral issue in London (the U.K. was fighting a war purportedly against slavery in West Africa and the Ashanti Empire in 1873), and the British Empire thus declared war on the khanate around the same time as Moscow. This war against slavery by two Christian states against a Muslim khanate was a major part of the Great Game, even more important than the Afghanistan campaign waged by both empires. The Russian Imperial Army took about two months to fully conquer Khiva, but because of its rivalry with Britain, the khanate survived as a sovereignty by becoming a protectorate (this was done so that the British could not use anti-Russian propaganda to foster unrest). Central Asia today looks much like it did when the Russians marched into the region to establish an empire and enact imperial reforms: loosely governed from Moscow, but still well within its orbit.<br>8. Battle of Tsushima (May 27 and 28, 1905). Fought between Russia and Japan on the high seas of East Asia, this massive battle saw the Russian Imperial Navy get destroyed by the up-and-coming Japanese Imperial Navy. The battle is known by military historians as being the only battle with steel battleships involved leading to a decisive victory (for Japan), but what is less known is that Russia had to send an entire squadron from the Baltic to the Pacific - around Africa due to Russia being banned from using the Suez Canal - to meet the Japanese head on. The Russians suffered heavy casualties as the Japanese Navy was larger, better equipped, more familiar with the terrain, and closer to home. Russia lost all of its battleships and most of its other fighting warships, too. It essentially ended the Russo-Japanese War and showed observers everywhere that there was a new sick man of Europe to keep a weary, hungry eye on.<br>9. Battle of Borodino (September 7, 1812). This was the only major battle fought between Napoleonic France and Russia on Russian soil. The Russians lost, and Moscow was captured because of it, but this was a pyrrhic victory for Napoleon’s revolutionary army. The Russians knew they couldn’t defeat a better trained, better equipped army, so they just kept retreating, burning as they went. The scorched earth tactics demoralized French generals and starved French troops. If the Russian people starved, too, you would never hear about it. They were just taking one for the team, after all. The battle itself saw maybe 40,000 Russian soldiers lose their lives, but it also led to the deaths of roughly 30,000 invading French troops. And that was before the infamous Russian winter made its appearance. To illustrate just how massive Russia had become, this battle was being fought at the same time that Moscow’s tsardom was waging an offensive war against Persia in the Caucasus. Incredible.<br>10. Battle of Stalingrad (1942-43). You didn’t think I would forget about this one, did you? If ever there were an invasion to illustrate Russian resolve, it would be this one. Ian Johnson, writing at War on the Rocks, has a better summary of the battle than I could ever hope to write, so I’ll just outsource to him on that front. Russia’s relationship with what is now Germany began in the early 18th century with Moscow’s defeat of Sweden in the Great Northern War. This introduced a formal Russian state to its new German-speaking neighbors and the many polities they governed. For the next 300 years these two peoples were enemies, allies, frenemies, and, above all else, peoples speaking different languages, worshipping Jesus Christ in a different manner from one another, and looking at the world from different geographic lenses. The differences between the two peoples today have hardly changed.<br>Further thoughts<br>Thankfully the United States and Russia have never come to blows the same way that Moscow and her neighbors have. I am optimistic that we can keep it this way, though I am also pessimistic about the future of liberty in Russia. Socialism has rightly become a loathed relic of Russia’s past, but its ugly cousin - fascism - is now, I fear, en vogue.<br>This doesn’t necessarily mean Russia will become more aggressive in foreign affairs, but given its long, storied, beautifully tragic past, it also means we really have no idea what to expect, except that the Russians we happen across will be dour, smirk-inducing funny, and full of confident answers to the probing questions that Westerners have for the Russians of today. With a history like theirs, who can blame them?</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Last weekend RCH delivered the 10 Most Important Battles in Ottoman History, sans those fought against (and with) the Russians, due to the fact that the two empires were such bitter rivals. From the late 16th century to the end of World War I - a span of roughly 350 years - the Russians and the Turks fought each other in contests for imperial dominance over the Balkans, the Black Sea, the Caucasus, and the straits of the Bosporus and Dardanelles.<br>Today, the Balkans are a hodgepodge of independent nation-states, the Black Sea and the Caucasus are dominated by Russia, and the straits of the Bosporus and Dardanelles are colloquially referred to as the “Turkish straits.” So the 350-year rivalry went unresolved. To complicate matters, the predecessor state of the Ottoman Empire’s main power base, Turkey, allied itself with the enemy of the Russian Empire’s predecessor state, the Soviet Union, and the countries remained locked down in a Cold War for another half century after their empires collapsed.<br>Today, both countries are governed by strongmen with aspirations of reviving their countries’ old empires. Vladimir Putin, the leader of the Russian Federation, and Recep ErdoÄ?an, the leader of Turkey, are close geopolitical associates, and the two of them work closely with a third strongman, Ayatollah Khomeini, who governs the predecessor state of the Persian Empire (a rival contemporary of both the Russian and Ottoman empires), Iran.<br>Turkey’s slide into despotism has been marked internationally by a willingness to part ways with the values held by members of NATO (its Cold War ally) and the European Union, and closer working relationships with Russia and Iran. This slide may be overblown by analysts. Turkey has, since its founding in 1923, always been a bit more authoritarian than its Western allies, and Turkey’s democracy has been marred by coups and counter-coups throughout its short history as a republic. Russia, for its part, became the main ethnic and territorial base of a superpower, the Soviet Union, during the Cold War before scrambling to rebuild itself after the U.S.S.R.’s collapse in 1991. Democracy has never been able to gain a solid foothold in the land of the Russians.<br>Below are the 10 Most Important Wars fought between the Russian and Ottoman empires over the past 400 years. Behold:<br>10. Russo-Turkish War of 1568-70. The first war between the upstart Russian Empire and the long-established Ottoman Empire served as a sign of things to come. The Ottomans had plans to build a canal through a region that was recently conquered by Ivan the Terrible and incorporated into the Russian Empire he was busy establishing. The Ottomans thought so little of this upstart and his army that they proceeded with their plans to build the canal by bringing a small army with the engineering corps to deal with the nuisance. The Ottoman plan was to build the canal while its army dealt with the pest. To make a long story short, the Ottoman army froze to death and its navy was wiped out in a storm, but only after both units received a bloody beating at the hands of the Russian military.<br>9. Russo-Turkish War of 1676-81. Fresh off its acquisition of the right half of what is now Ukraine, the Ottomans sought to continue their expansion into Slavic territories, but did so using proxies. A local khan with ties to Polish and Russian aristocrats, as well as ties to Crimea (a vassal of the Ottomans), used his network to try and seize all of Ukraine for himself in the name of Istanbul. The Ottomans were happy to let this local arrangement play out, due to the fact that blood and treasure was being spilt and spent by proxies, and the Russians had to expend considerable resources to put down Istanbul’s proxy. No borders changed hands, but Russian resentment of Ottoman interference in domestic affairs boiled over five years later.<br>8. Russo-Turkish War of 1686-1700. Part of the larger anti-Ottoman, joint-European effort, the Russian Empire joined with Venice, Austria, and Poland-Lithuania to push the Ottomans out of Hungary, Poland, and parts of the Balkans. While the Ottomans lost out big time, the Russians gained immensely, and not just at the expense of the Turks. In order to join an alliance against the Ottomans, Russia secured Kievan Ukraine from Poland-Lithuania and managed to save its strength, by letting its Western allies do most of the fighting against the Ottomans, for an upcoming war for supremacy in the Baltics against Sweden (which it won). Russia also got the fortresses of Azov and Taganrog from the Ottomans, as well as two regionally important commercial cities, Pavlovsk and Mius.<br>7. Russo-Turkish War of 1710-11. This short-lived war, also known as the Pruth River Campaign, took place after Sweden, a regional rival of Russia’s in the 15th and 16th centuries, was crushed by Moscow in the Battle of Poltava (1709). The king of Sweden, Charles XII, was wounded in the battle and barely escaped with his life to an Ottoman fortress in what is now Moldova. The Russians followed the Swedish king and his fleeing army to the fortress and demanded that the Ottomans hand him over. Istanbul declined to do so. The Russians, led by Peter the Great, attacked and were smashed by the larger, better-equipped Ottoman army. The Ottomans got Azoz back, and a guarantee from Russia that Charles XII would get safe passage back to Sweden. The Russians were further forced to pledge that they would no longer interfere in the internal affairs of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, an ally (at the time) of the Ottomans.<br>6. Russo-Turkish War of 1735-39. One of the more complicated wars between the two powers, the Austro-Russo-Turkish War of 1737-39 was actually a war fought between Russia and the Ottomans over Persian territory before the Austrians got in on the act. The Ottoman and Russian empires had made a habit out of picking the Persian empire apart in the early 18th century, due to the latter’s decline, but Russia began signing treaties with the Persians while the Ottomans kept picking away. Eventually, the Russians allied with the Persians against the Ottomans and opened up a front along the Black Sea. The entrance of Russia into the war against Persia forced the Ottomans to sue for peace with the Persians, but the two powers continued to fight, militarily and diplomatically. Austria entered the war on the side of Russia, but the Ottomans had alliances with Prussia, Poland, and Sweden, and the latter was an especially dangerous threat to Russia. The Ottomans made quick work of the Austrian armies, but the Russians advanced steadily onto Ottoman lands. Plagues and bad logistics forced the Russians to retreat from the advances they had made, and Swedish threats along Russia’s northern borders forced Moscow to make a hasty peace with the Ottomans.<br>5. Russo-Turkish War of 1768-74. This war marked the beginning of the end of the Ottoman Empire. Russia gained substantial territory at the expense of the Turks, and the idea of a Christian Europe at odds with a Muslim Sultanate began to take shape more fully as ideas about Europe became more widespread. The Ottomans were supposed to win this war due to the fact that Russia was strained from the just-concluded Seven Years’ War and was facing violent rebellion in Poland. In addition, the Ottoman naval fleet in the Black Sea was at full strength and the Ottoman military was believed at the time to be the most technologically advanced in the world (as well as one of the largest). The Russians crushed the Turks, and attempts by the U.K., France, and Austria to limit Russian power through diplomacy proved fruitless. The Russians continued crushing the Turks in the Mediterranean, the Caucasus, and Crimea. By the time Moscow was finished with the Ottomans, the “Eastern Question” was abuzz in Europe and wouldn’t end until the conclusion of World War I.<br>4. Russo-Turkish War of 1787-92. Humiliated after their defeat 13 years earlier, the Ottomans demanded that the Russians give back Crimea and some other important Black Sea ports. The Russians, along with their new allies Austria, instead declared war on the Ottoman Empire and proceeded to clean the Turks’ clock. The Russians marched right up to the gates of Istanbul and claimed that they wanted to make it Christian again, but an Ottoman alliance with Prussia forced Moscow to think twice about sacking the Ottoman capital and a peace treaty forcing Istanbul to recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea and Ukraine was signed instead. Meanwhile, Russian propaganda continued to flow into Greece and the protests against Ottoman rule there were becoming violent.<br>3. Russo-Turkish War of 1806-12. Known as the Ottoman front during the Napoleonic Wars, this Russo-Turkish War did not go as planned for Istanbul. Russia was just too powerful for the Turks, even though it was backpedalling from its war against revolutionary France. The Russians, who were getting a beating from the French, still managed to have enough strength to take a bit more land from the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman navy was soundly defeated in the Black Sea, too, marking the end of Ottoman dominance over its seas. Russian gains in the Caucasus were given back to Ottomans in the ensuing treaty, though, because of preparations for Napoleon’s invasion of Russia. Were it not for France’s impending invasion, the Ottomans could have lost much more territory than they did in the war.<br>2. Crimean War 1853-56. The Ottoman Empire managed one last victory over its hated rival in the Crimean War. Istanbul was so weak at this time that France, the U.K., and Russia were fighting among themselves over how Christians should be treated in Ottoman lands. The Russians sought to use Ottoman treatment of Christians as an excuse to carve up more land for Mother Russia, while the Western powers sought to limit Russian expansion into the Holy Lands. Seeing a chance to regain some of its prominence, the Ottoman Empire joined forces with the British and French and three sides forced Russia to sue for peace after a brutal three-year campaign in Russian territory. It was the last victory the Turks would have over the Russians, though the Ottomans did not gain any new territory, the Russians were prohibited from maintaining a naval fleet in the Black Sea.<br>1. World War I 1914-18. World War I marked the downfall of not only the Ottoman Empire but the Russian Empire as well. Both were destroyed. The Republic of Turkey replaced the Ottoman Empire in Anatolia and the Turkish Straits, and the Soviet Union replaced Russia as the largest polity, by territory, in the world.<br>Further thoughts<br>The Russo-Turkish Wars were a big deal, and they often involved international alliances and intrigue. The shadows of these old empires can be found in the present-day countries of Iraq, Syria, Belarus, Poland, Germany, Israel, Lebanon, Ukraine, Moldova, Hungary, Egypt, Jordan, Georgia, Armenia, Austria, Spain, Greece, Italy, Serbia, and Azerbaijan.<br>The alliances they built and the wars they fought against Great Powers - Sweden, the United Kingdom, France, and Iran (Persia) - made waves throughout the world.<br>When observing international affairs today, and watching the strongmen of Turkey and Russia pal around and collude against Western interests, it would be wise to remember the history of these two leaders’ societies. The past several decades have been tumultuous for the Ottoman and Russian empires, and while they longer appear on world maps, these empires are still very much alive in the minds of some.</div>

</mark>
 in Russian policy.<br>From the vantage point of two longtime Russia watchers — one a Republican who served in the George W. Bush administration and the other a Democrat who served in the Pentagon under President Bill Clinton — Boehner misses the point.<br>That central point is that Russia matters a great deal to a U.S. government seeking to defend and advance its national interests. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s decision to return next year as president makes it all the more critical for Washington to manage its relationship with Russia through coherent, realistic policies.<br>No one denies that Russia is a dangerous, difficult, often disappointing state to do business with. We should not overlook its many human rights and legal failures. Nonetheless, Russia is a player whose choices affect our vital interests in nuclear security and energy. It is key to supplying 100,000 U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan and preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.<br>Ten realities require U.S. policymakers to advance our nation’s interests by engaging and working with Moscow.<br>First, Russia remains the only nation that can erase the United States from the map in 30 minutes. As every president since John F. Kennedy has recognized, Russia’s cooperation is critical to averting nuclear war.<br>Second, Russia is our most consequential partner in preventing nuclear terrorism. Through a combination of more than $11 billion in U.S. aid, provided through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, and impressive Russian professionalism, two decades after the collapse of the “evil empire,” not one nuclear weapon has been found loose.<br>Third, Russia plays an essential role in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile-delivery systems. As Washington seeks to stop Iran’s drive toward nuclear weapons, Russian choices to sell or withhold sensitive technologies are the difference between failure and the possibility of success.<br>Fourth, Russian support in sharing intelligence and cooperating in operations remains essential to the U.S. war to destroy Al Qaeda and combat other transnational terrorist groups.<br>Fifth, Russia provides a vital supply line to 100,000 U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan. As U.S. relations with Pakistan have deteriorated, the Russian lifeline has grown ever more important and now accounts for half all daily deliveries.<br>Sixth, Russia is the world’s largest oil producer and second largest gas producer. Over the past decade, Russia has added more oil and gas exports to world energy markets than any other nation. Most major energy transport routes from Eurasia start in Russia or cross its nine time zones. As citizens of a country that imports two of every three of the 20 million barrels of oil that fuel U.S. cars daily, Americans feel Russia’s impact at our gas pumps.<br>Seventh, Moscow is an important player in today’s international system. It is no accident that Russia is one of the five veto-wielding, permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, as well as a member of the G-8 and G-20. A Moscow more closely aligned with U.S. goals would be significant in the balance of power to shape an environment in which China can emerge as a global power without overturning the existing order.<br>Eighth, Russia is the largest country on Earth by land area, abutting China on the East, Poland in the West and the United States across the Arctic. This territory provides transit corridors for supplies to global markets whose stability is vital to the U.S. economy.<br>Ninth, Russia’s brainpower is reflected in the fact that it has won more Nobel Prizes for science than all of Asia, places first in most math competitions and dominates the world chess masters list. The only way U.S. astronauts can now travel to and from the International Space Station is to hitch a ride on Russian rockets. The co-founder of the most advanced digital company in the world, Google, is Russian-born Sergei Brin.<br>Tenth, Russia’s potential as a spoiler is difficult to exaggerate. Consider what a Russian president intent on frustrating U.S. international objectives could do — from stopping the supply flow to Afghanistan to selling S-300 air defense missiles to Tehran to joining China in preventing U.N. Security Council resolutions.<br>So next time you hear a policymaker dismissing Russia with rhetoric about

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">The release of a long-delayed report on Russian interference in the United Kingdom by the British cross-party Intelligence and Security Committee has inevitably revived the debate about how a democratic state can best resist Moscow’s meddling.<br>The trouble is, of course, that political point-scoring and competitive rhetoric quickly dominate such discussions. The Intelligence and Security Committee refused to grapple seriously with whether or not Russian political operations affected the outcome of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum or the 2016 Brexit vote. Along with a general lack of clarity on just how certain sources of potential influence, from oligarchs to trolls, may affect the political system, this means everyone can put their own personal spin on the issue. The risk, then, is that this simply generates a short-term storm of comment, reaching few actionable policy conclusions, that is soon overtaken by the next issue of the moment.<br>This would be to squander an opportunity. The administration already has a Russia strategy intended to minimize the impact of Russian activities in the short term, while working for

 The Intelligence and Security Committee is brutal in dissecting what it sees as an uncoordinated process in Whitehall, though, and a lack of clear tactics as to how to advance the strategy, so here are 10 suggestions.<br>1. Tackle the ‘Oligarch Problem,’ but First Decide What It Is<br>Rich Russians have flocked to London, and their wealth buys them a degree of political leverage: Is this a security problem, an ethical challenge, or simply how Britain has always done business? The report raises concerns about the way that the United Kingdom has become a favored destination for rich Russians and their dirty money. Apparently,

 One particular weakness is that the Intelligence and Security Committee gives no examples of how this practice actually influenced the political process, and how the Kremlin may have benefited from this.<br>Of course, there are close ties between many rich Russians and the Kremlin, just as there are between many rich Chinese expats and the Communist Party, for example. Arguably, this is not a “Russian oligarch” issue but a wider problem of how money can buy access and leverage, distorting the democratic process on behalf of foreign interests. In this case, it needs to be tackled across the board, addressing everything from media control to political funding.<br>It would be nice to think of the United Kingdom becoming a superpower of ethics. Let’s be honest, though: It prizes its role as a magnet for global assets. Especially while facing the potential economic hit of Brexit, no British government is going to be eager to turn away foreign cash. The priority is going to be to deal with the immediate threat that rich Russians could become Russian President Vladimir Putin’s lobbyists.<br>The British government will need the will and the powers to tackle specific cases where Russian money is buying influence at the Kremlin’s behest. This is a tough problem, which is really in the realm of the intelligence services rather than the police. However, being more cautious about handing out passports to rich Russians (so that they can more easily be deported or excluded) and having a register of 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

</mark>
 (criminalizing acting as an instrument of the Kremlin without declaring that role) is a start. In truth, it is no more than that, but for the present it probably represents the most that is politically feasible.<br>However, we also need to be honest here: Just as welcoming rich Russians into the United Kingdom and allowing them to enjoy all the benefits of a law-based democratic society did not, as the Intelligence and Security Committee notes, lead to reform in Russia, so too cracking down on them now will not put meaningful pressure on the Kremlin. Putin is committed to a personal agenda of great-power politics and building his historical legacy. If some oligarchs have to lose some of the millions they have already been allowed to steal on his watch, he will not be especially concerned.<br>2. Russian Organized Crime Is Not Just for the Police<br>The expat “Londongrad” set has to be seen to work within the law; an even more serious potential threat that needs to be addressed comes from gangsters mobilized as tools of the Kremlin.<br>In parallel, there needs to be a sharper focus on the aspects of transnational crime that pose a clear and present national security threat. Russian-based organized crime has been used to generate chyornaya kassa funds (

 or deniable and untraceable moneys), carry out assassinations abroad, and even smuggle wanted agents across borders. Most recently, a Georgian Chechen was gunned down in Berlin by what seems to have been a gangster hitman, recruited by Russia’s Federal Security Service, and an online fraudster accused of stealing up to $2 billion is allegedly being protected by Russian military intelligence. Kremlin outsourcing of its operations to criminals continues unabated.<br>In the United Kingdom, despite regular rhetorical statements about taking a tough line on Russian criminality, it has in practice been a lower priority for police agencies. There have been several high-profile deaths of Russians but in practice most were probably not murders (allegations of untraceable poisons and carefully contrived fake accidents notwithstanding) and those which were essentially resulted from criminal score-settling. Only two, the murder of defector Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 and attempted killing of turned Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in 2018, have been ascribed to the Kremlin.<br>The threat appears limited to Russians who themselves were likely involved in questionable activities, and generally driven purely by business interests. To be blunt, for the police, this makes them less of a concern than the gangs directly responsible for public disquiet. As

 Instead, in the United Kingdom, Russian-based gangs largely operate as a facilitator and wholesale supplier behind the more immediately dangerous gangs. However much sense it may make from a public safety perspective to give them a lower priority, because of the wider national security concern, the National Crime Agency needs to be tasked — and resourced — with giving Russian gangs a harder time.<br>3.

 onto a hapless and helpless nation. You can’t bribe an honest official and likewise it’s hard to get traction on the minds of people who are essentially content with the status quo and who trust their politicians and the mainstream media. The reason there is such an appetite for alternative narratives is that, at present, just as elsewhere in the West, the United Kingdom is going through a legitimacy crisis. Communities that feel alienated and unheard are the natural constituency for information operations peddling alternative answers, conspiracy theories, and bile.<br>Just as with the struggle against narcotics, it’s easy to focus on supply rather than demand. Already there are renewed calls for Russian foreign-language TV channel RT to be banned, for example. To be sure, RT does carry blatant propaganda (just as it also carries decent news coverage), but an outlet with just 3,400 viewers at any one time is not a serious threat. Likewise, the fad for myth-busting operations meant to counter “fake news” is always tempting for governments keen to be seen to act, and bureaucracies that mistake activity for impact, but there is little credible evidence they really work except as part of a wider program.<br>One clear organizational recommendation in the Intelligence and Security Committee report is that the Security Service (better known as MI5) ought to be responsible for the integrity of the democratic process. The implication is that the challenge comes mainly from hackers and trolls. But this isn’t the case, and following this advice would be disastrous. In reality, Britain’s main problem consists of alienated communities. It would be unwise to basically put MI5 in charge of policing thought crime and news accuracy, let alone media education.<br>Of course, there should be proper media and social media regulation, but this should not be confined to Russian outlets. Instead, the harder and more important task is to address demand. In part, the answer is media education, and not just for schoolchildren but at every level, including seniors (this doesn’t have to be in a classroom: as the fight against cigarettes and drugs has shown, even storylines in soap operas have their role) to create resilience against this problem. It is also a much bigger issue, about closing

Many of the more nefarious, involving corruption, blackmail, chyornaya kassa support for subversive political movements and the like are managed or supported by Russia’s extensive intelligence community.

 — the usual bureaucratese for doing more with the same.<br>This is not enough: The suggestion that the intelligence community should be able to mount more effective information-gathering against what is still a hard target like Russia, and also do more to counter aggressive activity from Moscow, and also maintain existing commitments to other problems and challenges — all on the same budget — is unsustainable. More money for U.K. intelligence will be a sound investment when set against the direct and indirect costs of everything from technological secrets lost to Russian hacking to the political impact of covert influence. These funds will also better position Britain to cope with another increasingly adversarial actor: the People’s Republic of China.<br>5. A War with Russia Is Unlikely, but Planning for It Is Critical<br>In raw terms — although these comparisons are as meaningless as they are tempting — the U.K. and Russian defense budgets are quite similar. Of course, in real terms, Russia’s is perhaps three times as large. The United Kingdom does not need to plan to win or deter a one-on-one war with Russia, though, being both part of NATO and also on the other side of Europe. The question becomes, then, how far the Russian challenge ought to inform British defense planning and spending, something that will increasingly also mean cyber security in an age of ubiquitous connectivity and undeclared, ambiguous conflicts. Britain cannot pretend to be able — or need — to deter Russia itself, but it must stop trying and failing to do everything. Instead, it should make a serious commitment to being able to mount expeditionary operations as part of wider alliances, but to be able to do so in the face of the latest Russian tactics and technologies.<br>Britain clearly wants to play a credible role within NATO: It already spends a greater proportion of its gross domestic product on defense than most members. It also has particular interests of its own relating to defending its territorial waters and lines of communication to overseas territories, aims that sometimes rub up against Russian operations. Although the planning for the next integrated Strategic Defense and Security Review, due this year, was temporarily paused because of COVID-19, some tough decisions will soon have to be made. As

<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    “whether to accelerate and expand the modernisation of its heavy forces, or move away from heavy forces and prioritise the development of resilient reconnaissance and fires.”

<br>So far, the government looks inclined toward the latter in order to maintain a credible rapid expeditionary capability, not least as this fits the continued commitment to a “Global Britain.” Nonetheless, as Moscow sells more and more of its latest kit to buyers around the world, even if they will not be facing Russia, British forces will have to be configured and prepared to fight Russian-equipped and -trained forces. Besides which, as deterrence is anchored on signaling capability and intent, the United Kingdom ought to look willing and able to take on Russian forces. There is, it seems, no escaping the continued centrality of Russia in British military thinking.<br>6. Cultivate Solidarity by Defending Others<br>Alliances also matter in responding to non-military challenges. Following the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in 2018, Moscow was surprised and shaken when Britain successfully brokered a campaign of expulsion of 130 suspected Russian spies from 28 states plus NATO. This was a striking and groundbreaking example of international solidarity of a sort that had been sadly absent until then. And since then, for that matter, but if the United Kingdom wants to be able to call on similar support in the future, it has to make preparations now and also be willing to offer it to others, and not be dependent on ad hoc responses. This ought not to be focused on NATO, nor — in a time of Brexit — the European Union. Rather, it should be a coalition of the willing, perhaps starting with the Anglosphere “Five Eyes” intelligence partners (the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), expressing a willingness collectively to respond to future Russian adventurism.<br>7. Engagement Is a Weapon Too<br>The answer to Russian “political war” intended to divide, distract, and demoralize is generally not to try to fight fire with fire. There is not only a moral high ground to be lost — a central element of Putin’s narrative is that Russia is simply responding to Western subversion — but open, democratic societies tend to be more vulnerable to any such active measures arms race. Instead, it is worth considering how the best lessons of the Cold War can be adapted and amplified in the modern age, using soft power to counter Putin’s

 predisposed to tyranny and aggression, change is not only possible but inevitable. While containing Kremlin aggression and interference, this must be balanced with a sustained and meaningful effort to engage. There is still a strong vein of Anglophilia in Russian culture: encourage and magnify this. Student bursaries, cultural exchanges, extravagant celebrations of historical ties between the two countries (remember: Ivan the Terrible even offered Queen Elizabeth I his blood-stained hand in marriage), all of this will have minimal impact today — especially as the Kremlin does what it can to limit them — but will reap benefits in the future, when London will be able, rightly, to tell the Russians it never abandoned them.<br>They have few illusions about their own leaders, so exposing their corruptions and hypocrisies is of limited real value (even though some in the West think this is their magic bullet). More broadly, using the capabilities of the modern media to support Russia’s brave independent media and also puncture some of the Kremlin’s lies would accelerate the existing decay of the regime’s legitimacy. The BBC still has a powerful brand, and it can be a powerful link to Russians who increasingly get their news online. That does not mean being a propaganda arm — it is important to be objective, and that includes highlighting Russian successes, too — but rather, along with British academia, a counter to increasingly blatant Kremlin efforts to mobilize today’s news and yesterday’s history to its ends.<br>8.

<br>There can be little hope of truly meaningful improvement of relations with Russia so long as Putin and his cronies continue to govern the country. Previous attempts at “resets” such as U.S. President Barack Obama’s in 2009 have been grandiose exercises in self-deception, as French President Emmanuel Macron will discover, if he goes ahead with a similar outreach of his own. Putin’s people are the products of a Soviet upbringing, the kleptocracy rooted in the lawless 1990s, and a bitter sense that Russia’s global status was somehow

 by the West. It is highly unlikely that they will change.<br>However, that political generation is getting older. Putin could reign until 2036, but it is not clear that he even wants to or that his health would allow him to do so. The younger political elite, while dutifully echoing the Kremlin’s anti-Western talking points, show no signs of really being as enthusiastic about a geopolitical crusade. They are more likely to be pragmatic opportunists, who would love to return to the days of being able to steal at home, bank and spend abroad. These days, for anyone but the super-rich, it is harder and harder to travel to the West, let alone move money there, not just because of our controls, but also because the Kremlin is cracking down on capital flight.<br>The Russian people seem even less consumed by the strident Kremlin propaganda. Surveys show them being much more positive toward Westerners than vice versa. They do not accept the official line that their country is under threat and — now that the “Crimea effect” has worn off — show no enthusiasm for foreign adventures. Russia won’t become a liberal democracy any time soon, but the United Kingdom can have reasonable relations with all kinds of hybrid reforming or even downright authoritarian states. It is the Kremlin’s demand for a special status, for a sphere of influence, and for the right to flout international norms and laws that causes the problem, and this is likely to prove very much a product of Putin’s transitional generation.<br>9.

<br>The people who are expected to implement policy ought to understand the country with which they are dealing. That policy ought to be rooted in a detailed, nuanced grasp of the country.

 responses. The strategy is in the hands of the National Security Strategy Implementation Group for Russia, which brings together 14 different departments and agencies under the chair of the Russia Unit in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Much has been done to involve stakeholders in discussions, but in at least some cases, the sense has been — which is, of course, code for the gossip I have heard from different quarters — that participants treated this as an opportunity to advance their own departmental interests, or simply to make a show of participation. The strategy needs to have teeth, and it is open to discussion whether those of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are sharp enough. If not, either they need honing or the Cabinet Office ought to be responsible for, if not running the group, at least playing a role as its genteel leg-breaker, given that this is arguably its main function in Whitehall.<br>The point is, after all, that all this matters. It matters not just in terms of the challenge from Moscow — which, after all, needs to be taken seriously, but not exaggerated — but also because the skills, policies, attitudes, and strategy adopted today are likely to be needed to face rather more problematic threats tomorrow. As China moves into the “wolf warrior diplomacy” phase of its rise, Britain might even want to thank the Kremlin for the early wake-up call and opportunity to build these capabilities.<br>Mark Galeotti is an honorary professor at University College London and a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).<br>Image: President of Russia</div>

Consider: If the westernmost tip of Russia were plopped on Los Angeles, and the country unrolled like a giant carpet, it would cross the continental U.S. and the Atlantic Ocean, roll over France, Germany, Austria and not run out till it got to Hungary.<br>Advertisement<br>2 Ivan the Terrible, the iron-fisted 16th-century ruler who was the first to officially take the title czar of all Russia, was indeed terrible from any modern viewpoint, torturing enemies and countrymen alike, and killing his son in an uncontrolled rage. But that's not what his nickname is referencing. His moniker — based on the Russian word grozny — is more accurately rendered as fearsome or formidable.<br>3 Vodka and cigarettes are among the culprits for a 12-year gap in life expectancies between men and women in Russia — 76 years for women and 64 for men. Russian men live shorter lives than those in North Korea, Indonesia and Bangladesh. (In the U.S., average life spans are 81 for women, 76 for men.)<br>Advertisement<br>4 The surface area of Lake Baikal in Siberia is only about half as big as that of Lake Michigan, yet Baikal is so deep it holds one-fifth of the world's freshwater, about as much as the five Great Lakes combined.<br>5 In fall 1863, as the U.S. was embroiled in the Civil War, the Russian navy without warning sailed warships into the Northern ports of New York and San Francisco. Did it spark a panic? No, it was the occasion for extravagant parties. Before the Soviets were the Evil Empire, the Russians were America's fast friends. The fleets stayed the winter, and the strong show of support from a major European power was thought at the time to end talk of British or French intervention on the side of the Confederacy. It was later learned that the Russians, fearing an imminent fight of their own with Britain or France, needed to find a safe place to stow their warships.<br>6

 It’s a familiar trope: Patrushev years ago accused former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright of saying that Siberia and the Far East should not belong to Russia. This allegation had no known basis in fact, leading to speculation that it originated in a top-secret project where Moscow spies hired mindreaders to tap into the thoughts of Western leaders.<br>With Putin spending most of his time in the Kremlin, Patrushev has assumed a more active role, recently visiting China amid growing concerns there over the war.

The job swap enabled Putin to keep power in his own hands while complying with the constitutional term limits that then applied. Medvedev duly kept the presidential seat warm while getting a passing grade as a modernizer — governing by iPad and touring Silicon Valley. But, when his four-year term was up, Medvedev meekly made way for Putin’s return to the Kremlin.<br>Medvedev went on to serve for eight more years as prime minister before in 2020 becoming deputy chairman of the Security Council — again directly subordinate to Putin who heads it. War has been unkind to Medvedev, whose attempts to shed his image as Putin’s less-evil twin by posing as a nuclear madman have been drowned out by outbursts of hysterical laughter from readers of his Telegram channel. At 57, Medvedev is still young enough to rule Russia again but his own fate is inseparably tied to Putin’s.<br>Likelihood:<br>Scariness:<br>The Bodyguard — Alexei Dyumin<br>By his own account, Alexei Dyumin once saved Putin from a night-time attack by a brown bear, emptying the clip of his service pistol at the beast’s feet as it stood menacingly in the doorway of a mountain retreat.

<br>The Troika<br>Perhaps the closest historical parallel to the autocratic Putin is that of Stalin, whose death in 1953 sparked a power struggle in which a short-lived “troika” ended with the execution of one of its members, hated former secret police chief Lavrenty Beria. Khrushchev went on to sideline premier Georgy Malenkov in 1955, emerging unchallenged as leader of both the Communist Party and the government.

 by the prime minister. That puts Mikhail Mishustin in pole position to take over as acting head of state should Putin fall seriously ill or be assassinated. Mishustin, 56, was Russia’s chief tax collector before being named prime minister in 2020, when Putin pushed through those constitutional changes that, effectively, opened the way for him to become president for life.<br>The bald, burly Mishustin has served as a loyal crisis manager, working to minimize the economic fallout from Western sanctions. But there’s a potential twist: If Putin is incapacitated, the constitution does not explicitly allow him to stage a comeback should he recover. Could it be a case of finders keepers?<br>Likelihood:<br>Scariness:<br>The Muscovite — Sergei Sobyanin<br>The quintessential insider, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin could emerge as a contender to succeed Putin if protests in the capital escalate to the point where repression is no longer viable and constructive engagement is needed to complete an orderly transition. This is by no means a base-case scenario: Protests against Putin’s mobilization order are nowhere near reaching the scale of the Euromaidan movement in Kyiv that forced Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych from power in early 2014.<br>During his 12-year tenure, Sobyanin has proved to be an unspectacularly competent machine politician. He did a decent job of making the metropolis more livable — sprucing up parks, restoring historic buildings and upgrading public transport — until much of that progress was undone by war and sanctions. The 64-year-old was previously governor of the oil-rich Tyumen province (from 2001-05), head of the Kremlin administration (2005-08), and deputy prime minister to Putin (2008-10).<br>Likelihood:<br>Scariness:<br>COLOR REVOLUTION<br>Russians rise up against Putin<br>Putin’s pathological resolve to wipe Ukraine off the map stems from his terror that it could export a people-power “color” revolution to Russia. Ukrainians have not once, but twice, removed their leaders through peaceful protest, in the Orange Revolution of 2004-05 and the Euromaidan protests a decade later. Could it happen?<br>The Prisoner — Alexei Navalny<br>Anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny would be the prime candidate to lead a Russian color revolution, having helped organize protests against Putin’s return to the presidency a decade ago. Those demonstrations — the largest in post-Soviet Russia — ultimately failed. But Navalny persisted, channeling his efforts into exposing corruption. The state retaliated by poisoning Navalny with a nerve agent and jailing him on trumped-up fraud charges.<br>Showing extraordinary courage, Navalny continues to oppose the war from behind bars. But his chances of following Nelson Mandela from a prison cell to the presidency are slight. Observers can imagine a scenario in which Putin is ousted and Russia’s next leader, in a gesture of reconciliation toward the West, releases political prisoners such as Navalny, journalist Vladimir Kara-Murza or video blogger Ilya Yashin. But that would be only the first step on a long and tortuous path to power in a country that has yet to hold a free or fair election.<br>Likelihood:<br>Scariness:<br>The Exile — Mikhail Khodorkovsky<br>Former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky is another regime critic who took on Putin and lost, ending up being stripped of his Yukos oil empire, thrown into jail for 10 years and finally going into exile. His Open Russia foundation, banned in Russia, continues to campaign for reform, but Khodorkovsky himself displays no obvious ambition to stage a triumphant return and play a leadership role in a post-Putin Russia.<br>Khodorkovsky, 59, strongly supports Ukraine’s resistance against Russia, recently urging the West to supply more weapons. Yet his history as a ruthless businessman has not been forgotten by older Russians who still harbor bitter memories of the chaotic Yeltsin years, when an oligarch cabal amassed vast assets through corrupt privatizations that stripped the nation of its Soviet industrial patrimony.<br>Likelihood:<br>Scariness:<br>TIME OF TROUBLE<br>Putin is overthrown militarily<br>While modern Russia has no history of successful military coups, it would be a mistake to rule out the possibility of Putin being ousted in an armed uprising. Here are some key players to watch out for if Russia’s next ruler is chosen at the point of a gun:<br>The Butcher — Mikhail Mizintsev<br>Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff, have both had terrible wars, effectively ruling them out as credible leaders of any move by the military establishment to seize power. There’s no tradition in Russia of disgruntled officers staging a putsch — and many have already met their maker on the field of battle.<br>But there is one general who is thriving after earning a reputation for shocking brutality: Mikhail Mizintsev, the “butcher of Mariupol.” Mizintsev led the devastating siege in which more than 20,000 civilians died before the port city fell in May. He has just been promoted to deputy defense minister in charge of logistics, as Russia seeks to turn the tide against Ukraine’s latest offensive and end its mobilization chaos. Mizintsev may not be a direct contender for power but will be a face to watch in the days and weeks to come.<br>Likelihood:<br>Scariness:<br>The Warlord — Ramzan Kadyrov<br>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">The United States suffers from a severe case of strategic confusion, manifest in the country seeing enemies where none exist and showing an inability to concentrate action where they do exist. Given the immensity of American power relative to the rest of the world, this malady has a tendency to wreak havoc and generate tension in areas of American involvement. And the confusion seems so thoroughly embedded in the country’s collective psyche that prospects for any reversal remain dim. That bodes ill for America and for the world.<br>SPONSORED CONTENT Recommended by<br>Consider our actions, and their consequences, of the last fifteen years. Following the seminal events of September 11, 2001, when the country was attacked by that tightly wound Islamist knot of anti-Western fervor known as Al Qaeda, the United States toppled the Afghan regime that had succored Al Qaeda and dislodged the Islamist force from the habitat from which it sought to menace the West. This was necessary and entirely appropriate.<br>But then we invaded Iraq, ruled by a secular tyrant who had nothing to do with the kind of Islamist radicalism that was the true enemy. This generated multiple consequences of immense difficulty. It unleashed sectarian fears and passions in the country that for years destroyed prospects for stability—and led to the deaths of nearly 4,500 Americans and an estimated 174,000 Iraqis, most of them civilians. It enflamed the region in ways that spawned a new Al Qaeda force in Iraq where previously none had existed, or could exist. It upended a centuries-long balance of power between Sunni-dominated Iraq and Shiite Iran, thus creating new challenges of stability and new difficulties in the U.S.-Iran relationship. Perhaps worst of all, the Iraq invasion and its chaotic aftermath have sapped America’s appetite for confronting the true enemy in the Middle East.<br>The true enemy is Islamist fundamentalism, just as it was when President George W. Bush took America on the Iraq detour. The Al Qaeda aim then was to draw America into a desert quagmire and diminish its confidence, unity and strength. It couldn’t succeed in doing that without American strategic confusion.<br>What the U.S. invasion didn’t do was turn Iraq into a Middle Eastern model of democratic practice, as many invasion advocates, in their confusion, had predicted. Some people thought the so-called Arab Spring, a wave of seemingly pro-democracy protests across the Middle East beginning in December 2010, would usher in such a new era. President Obama promptly expressed support for the protesters, including some motivated more by Islamist fundamentalism than by true democratic impulses. He undermined the standing of Egypt’s Hosni Mubarak, a staunch U.S. ally for decades, and assisted the emergence of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood (which ruled the country for a time before the old military oligarchy regained governmental dominance).<br>This represented strategic confusion of a very high order. It had been Islamist fundamentalism that had attacked America on 9/11, that had attacked Britain and Spain in succeeding months, that had vowed a relentless terrorist campaign against the West. Mubarak was opposed to all that; the Muslim Brotherhood had flirted with that kind of radicalism for decades. Why would an American president undermine a foreign leader who was a steadfast U.S. ally and an opponent of the Islamist fundamentalism that represented one of America’s most menacing enemies? There’s only one answer: strategic confusion.<br>Then, when Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi found himself beleaguered by internal protests, Obama turned on Qaddafi, who had promised to end anti-Western terrorist activities and abandon efforts to produce weapons of mass destruction. In exchange, he was to be left alone. But Obama reneged, leading a bombing campaign against Qaddafi, who represented no threat to America whatsoever.

 That phrase in itself represents a highly distilled form of strategic confusion. Where does this responsibility lead us? How many bombing campaigns and wars would have to be waged if the protection and happiness of our fellow human beings, all around the world, were to be our global remit? What does this have to do with every president’s primary imperative of protecting America and its citizens, not humanity, from outside threats?<br>Then there’s Syria. When its brutal president, Bashar al-Assad, found himself beset by internal dissention, the U.S. government promptly adopted a position that he had to go. Then came the emergence of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL), potent enough to capture territory in Iraq and Syria and use that territory as spawning ground for further regional expansion and growing global menace. Its aim was to topple Assad and dominate, in the name of a restored caliphate, the lands that have been Syria since the end of World War I. Our aim was to thwart the further territorial gains of ISIS and destroy its ability to project terrorist activity into the West. Assad’s aim was to defend his country from the growing ISIS threat (along with other forces bent on destroying his regime). Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and the Kurds of Syria and Iraq all wanted to defeat ISIS.<br>A sensibility of strategic coherence in Washington would have produced a clear understanding: Since ISIS represents a major threat to regional stability as well as to the security of Western nations, whereas Assad represents no threat at all, the obvious approach would be to align with those forces bent on defeating ISIS and not worrying about the fate of Assad. But such strategic coherence eluded Washington policymakers, who couldn’t abandon their conviction that Assad must go. The result was a kind of policy paralysis, with Russia moving in and capturing the initiative with a much tighter view of the situation.<br>

 as repeating his constant refrain that Assad’s departure 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    “has to be part of a transition if you’re going to end the war”—hence more strategic confusion. A casual review of the relative power on the ground tells us that we can’t defeat ISIS while also waging war with ISIS’s primary opponent in Syria, the Assad regime, particularly as Assad is supported by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah.
Consider the strategic confusion of the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, when he wrote in a Washington Post piece that we need to create an anti-ISIS coalition made up of Kurds, Turks, Saudis, Egyptians and Jordanians. As conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan pointed out, his coalition (leaving aside the Kurds) includes countries and forces that haven’t demonstrated any serious anti-ISIS commitment, and excludes all the countries and forces that have demonstrated through dangerous action their opposition to ISIS.
This is not serious strategic thinking. It lacks even a rudimentary sense of the realities of the situation and hence lacks a potential for generating a decisive American initiative against ISIS. One big stumbling block for Romney and likeminded people is Russia, the subject of much strategic confusion in America.
Given its resources and position upon the Eurasian landmass, Russia always has and always will represent a potential threat to the West. That needs to be borne in mind in policymaking at all times. But Russia’s geopolitical center, lying unprotected behind vast expanses of steppe grasslands, also renders it highly vulnerable to invasion from the West, whence major incursions have emanated in just about every century of its existence. Given that, Russia inevitably will resist efforts to rip away its traditional areas of influence, including Crimea and Ukraine. It will resist NATO efforts to push up to the Russian border with rockets and troops. It will take umbrage when American NGOs and foreign policy officials whip up dissension in western Ukraine as a way of ripping that territory away from Russian dominance, which Russia has maintained almost uninterrupted for centuries.
Weighted down by strategic confusion, many American politicians and foreign policy officials seem to think that Russia can be kept at bay only by bellicose rhetoric and provocative policies, designed to push into Russia’s traditional spheres of influence and neutralize its influence. This won’t work. It will simply incite, as indeed it has incited, Russia’s natural sense of vulnerability, and stir provocative and bellicose responses.
A more strategically sound approach would be that which Otto von Bismarck adopted after he consolidated the German nation under Prussian auspices in 1871. Knowing this powerful new entity in the center of Europe would generate fears among its neighbors, he studiously refrained from actions that could exacerbate those fears. His aim was to project the image of a restrained and friendly power satisfied with its favorable position upon the continent. After Kaiser Wilhelm II dismissed Bismarck and embarked upon a policy of provocative military expansion, the European equilibrium collapsed, and a course was set toward World War I.

As the Kremlin’s domestic politics team gauged Russians’ reactions to these options in the wake of the January address, Putin initially appeared to be signaling that he would leave the Kremlin in May 2024, per the existing constitution, which prohibits anyone from serving more than two consecutive presidential terms.

My guess is that conservatives who dominate his inner circle and who are interested in extending his rule as much as possible have convinced him to expand the number of options available to him come 2024 to include a continuation of his presidency.<br>The theatricals meant to portray this expansion of options as someone else’s initiative started with

) The majority then quickly agreed to invite the president to appear in the Duma to discuss the matter, which he did. Putin accepted the invitation, and, as stated above, delivered a speech in which he touted his role in ensuring the country’s stability, but also conditioned his consent for resetting his number of presidential terms on having the nation’s Constitutional Court vet the proposal. Once he had spoken, Tereshkova and the rest of the Kremlin’s yes-women and -men voted to include the proposal into the raft of constitutional amendments before passing the full package to the upper chamber, the Federation Council, which is also dominated by Kremlin loyalists. The council wasted no time in endorsing the bill on March 11, with only one senator casting his vote against the amendments. The amendment package will now go to the Constitutional Court for vetting before it is put up for a nation-wide referendum on April 22.<br>Some of the nation’s leading constitutional law experts have already expressed reservations about the bill, but hardly anyone has any doubts that the Constitutional Court will endorse the amendment that would allow Putin to essentially become president for life if he wants to. Anyone who thinks otherwise should look up some of the public commentary by the court’s longtime chair, Valery Zorkin, who has not so long ago lamented what he saw as the negative consequences of abolishing serfdom in tsarist Russia (and never mind that he chairs the court supposed to ensure compliance with the law that enshrines the fundamental rights and freedoms of Russians). Public opinion has been split almost evenly between those who favor Putin staying in the Kremlin beyond 2024 and those who oppose it, but I expect those counting the ballots on April 22 to somehow ensure a resounding 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

 to this and other amendments.<br>There should also be no doubt that much of Russia’s ruling elite, which depends on Putin for jobs and fortunes, including some of the long-serving government ministers and chief executives of state-controlled conglomerates, stands to benefit from this arrangement both politically and financially. Kremlin tea-leaf-reading is never an easy exercise and we are yet to see whether Putin does decide to stay on as the president beyond 2024. What I am pretty confident in is that his continued stay in the Kremlin for two more terms, if not more, would bode ill for the long-term stable development of Russia, which saw its share of world’s gross domestic product and population shrink by 6 percent and 20 percent, respectively, on his watch, according to the IMF and World Bank. (Putin did preside over the period of impressive economic growth of 7 percent per year in the 2000s, but that fizzled out and his success in reversing depopulation in the 2010s proved to be short-lived).<br>Reversing these and other trends requires an orderly and timely transition of executive power, not a rewriting of the constitution to one man’s liking. It requires a system in which the executive, judicial and legislative branches of power balance and check each other in reality as opposed to just on paper. And it requires deep structural reforms that Putin welcomed in his first term, helping to foster a decade of growth, but then grew averse to as many in his retinue learned to benefit from the status quo. When anyone else will get a chance to move in to the Kremlin and whether he or she will then attempt such reforms is, as of this week, anyone’s guess.<br>Simon Saradzhyan is the founding director of Russia Matters.<br>The opinions in this article are solely those of the author.<br>Photo by kremlin.ru.</div>

    “a masterclass in whataboutism”—which might be defined as the strategic practice of deflecting criticism with counter-accusations against the criticizer, while implying hypocrisy and/or ignoring circumstances that could weaken one's argument but not addressing the original criticism.
This tactic was frequently employed by the Soviet Union in response to Western criticism of its domestic and foreign policies, with America most often in the crosshairs. One early use of whataboutism—a term coined much later in the West—followed a speech made by then U.S. Secretary of Commerce W. Averell Harriman in 1947, in which he warned that Soviet totalitarianism was “a new and more threatening imperialism.”

This step was almost instantly criticized by the Obama administration, with the U.S. president warning that Vladimir Putin is dragging his country into a quagmire. The Russian military operations in Syria have proved at times to be brutal and indiscriminate, causing many civilian deaths—nearly 4,000 in the first year of its campaign alone, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which continues to blame Russia for scores of civilian deaths with grim regularity. But has Russia gotten stuck in a quagmire or has it achieved any of its goals?

These diverse bodies developed different foci, ranging from the hard security oriented Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), to the economics driven Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), to the politico-security centered Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which Moscow established together with China. While sometimes its efforts were dismissed as nothing more than attempts to

 the Eurasian space, or were questioned for their intergovernmental character centered on the protection of the region’s entrenched governments, Russia’s true motivations were grounded in some practical needs. Among these, the most palpable were various security challenges that affected the post-Soviet space, a necessity of addressing globalization’s negative impact on the local economies, and a desire to settle a tense frontier with erstwhile Cold War rival China. Therefore, these institutions became essential vessels in Russia’s drive to deal with Central Asia’s complex environment, and also help it restore its formerly enjoyed status of a true global power.<br>What also needs to be noted is how, 20 years later, all of these institutions have significantly evolved from their modest beginning. This naturally followed Moscow’s changing view of their utility to its practical needs. While not being flawless by any stretch of imagination, the CSTO and EAEU made some noticeable achievements in improving regional military and economic cooperation and coordination. On the other hand, the SCO moved beyond its practical mandate and became a relevant international forum that brings together world’s largest non-Western nations. While Russia’s intentions toward it remain unclear, and its lobbying for SCO enlargement were criticized, Moscow generally sees a purpose behind every integrative mechanism it established or co-founded in the past 20 years.<br>Russia’s institutional push in Eurasia was always driven in part by its regional and global agendas.

 of the post-Soviet space, which was particularly visible in a deteriorating security situation stemming from instability in Afghanistan, the civil war in Tajikistan, and the clashes between its former Soviet Republics. Particularly worrying was the rise of the nonconventional threats like terrorism and drug smuggling. Part of this erosion included also a loss of influence over the post-Soviet space, in particular following the pro-democracy “color revolutions” in several former Soviet Republics like Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, which many in Russia saw as nothing short of West-sponsored plots. Hence, the CSTO is actually sometimes seen as an anti-NATO.<br>Columbia University scholar Alexander Cooley argues that the CSTO, and the Eurasian Economic Community or EurAsEC (a precursor to EAEU), are Russia’s attempts to emulate Western models like the NATO and the European Union. In many ways these institutions were organizationally modeled on the Western counterparts, although they come up short in their achievements. Nonetheless, the true motives for their creation are actually found in the declining security and economic situation of the former Soviet bloc, and the failure of the early post-Cold War integration, especially as embodied in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).<br>Diplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific.

 to Moscow’s feeling of rejection and a missed opportunity of forming a more inclusive pan-European security community following the end of the Cold War. After that episode, Russia then undertook its own integrative efforts, which coincided with a gradual restoration of its power, as well as its desire to reassume what it saw as its rightful place among the great powers of the world. Hence, we see a global agenda of Moscow’s institutional policy.

On the hard security end, Moscow sponsored the establishment of two institutions that appear to have overlapping responsibilities: the CSTO and SCO. The former evolved from the 1992 Collective Security Treaty, a basic agreement that envisioned mutual support among its members in case of an imminent external threat. This, however, proved to be inadequate and was eventually transformed into a real military alliance in October 2002 with a secretariat and a secretary general, a developed bureaucracy, and functions similar to those of NATO, including crisis time consultations. Perhaps the biggest accomplishment of the CSTO was the formation of a capable joint rapid reaction force in 2009 between its six member states. Since then, Moscow and its partners held numerous and diverse military drills and exercises that simulated peace-keeping, anti-drug smuggling, and anti-terror activities. In spite of these are tangible achievements, the organization’s clout over Central Asia is hampered by the lack of membership of strategically important Uzbekistan, and the continued refusal of NATO to deal with the CSTO as a relevant security provider.<br>On the other hand, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization is often considered as mainly a Chinese project, given that it was the first noneconomic body that the People’s Republic founded and led from its inception. It emerged at a time when Russia was still very weak and realized that if it stayed on the sidelines it would let China have its way. Hence, Moscow opted to join and partner with the new grouping and thus become an equal decisionmaker. The SCO proved to be a good platform for defusing tensions between these erstwhile Cold War rivals by settling border disputes and troop deployments. It also provided support to Moscow’s and Beijing’s smaller partners, some of which were not just challenged not just domestic and regional threats, but were often criticized by (mainly) Western states for their human rights record. As its relations with the West deteriorated, Russia envisioned the SCO as an alternative organization to the America-led order, and a place for 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    “great power posturing.”

<br>Nonetheless, Moscow seems to be undecided, and perhaps even dishonest, about the SCO. It does not wish for the CSTO to be displaced by the SCO as the region’s exclusive security provider. On the other hand, in spite of a formal endorsement of the developmental function of the SCO, Moscow did not support it. Russia recognizes the limitations of its ability to restrict China’s expanding influence in the Central Asia. Some scholars noted that Russia’s support for the enlargement, and in particular the admission of India, was done to try and offset China’s preponderant position inside of the SCO, but it effectively weakened the SCO’s ability to do much given the intraorganizational rivalries. Hence, it would appear that Russia prefers to keep the SCO as a prestigious club for non-Western states with a limited practical role.<br>Advertisement<br>Finally, the third of Russia’s Eurasian institutions, the EAEU, emerged from a collection of economic integrative efforts that go back to the mid-1990s, and really took speed in the early 2000s when EurAsEC was founded. Years later it was bolstered by a customs union and a single economic space. These were ultimately transformed into the Eurasian Economic Union starting from January 2015. EAEU had more supranational functions than either the CSTO or SCO, and its Commission (much like the EU’s) can make decision by a majority vote, and thus (theoretically) overrule even the largest member (Russia). Moreover, Moscow learned from the limitations of going for a high membership organization like the CIS. Therefore, the initial members were Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus, with Armenia and Kyrgyzstan subsequently joining the club, all of which seemed more committed to the project. They were motivated in no small part by the collapse of the GDP in the post-Soviet countries during the 1990s.<br>The initial economic integration with Kazakhstan and Belarus sought to restore some of the earlier economic activity and re-industrialize the region, and prepare it for joining globalization as a bloc. Later when the EAEU was established, another goal was added — building an intraregional capacity to better deal with the negative side of global capitalism. In spite of the fact that Eurasian integration is rightly viewed as the most serious attempt at integration since the collapse of the USSR, some considerable challenges remain. There are problems with implementation of various, sometimes easily given, pledges. Also, the economic results are still not there, and the intraregional trade seems to disproportionately favor Russia. Moreover, while the union seeks to promote free trade between members, there are still issues with nontariff barriers.<br>Overall, certain criticisms of the Russian institutional initiative are valid and point out genuine problems such as the competition and overlapping responsibilities between the CSTO and SCO, and the persistence of nontariff obstacles in what is supposed to be a free trade zone of the Eurasian Economic Union. No less relevant is the apparent lack of a strong unifying ideology behind what is supposed be a Russia-led regional bloc. Nonetheless, an argument in support of Eurasian institutionalism can be found in international relations theory. Most of the regimes in other parts of the world were built upon the existing ones. In the post-Soviet space, integration is essentially an effort to reintegrate states that were once part of the same state and whose level of economic interdependence is already high. If anything, this makes the process easier and the participants more familiar with each other.<br>Ultimately, as one eminent scholar of Russia noted, Eurasian institutionalism is a contested project. Moscow has shown remarkable persistence in funding and sponsoring these processes, and it also has displayed a willingness to evolve them and move onto other projects with more favorable and suitable arrangements that fulfilled its geopolitical or geoeconomic needs. However, its ultimate success will depend on factors that escape Russia’s full control, such as great power relations and domestic calculations among its smaller partners.<br>Janko Šćepanović is a Ph.D. Candidate in Internatioanl Politics at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs (SIRPA) of the Fudan Univeristy in Shanghai, People’s Republic of China.

<br>Electioneering<br>The year 2012 will be remarkable for the fact that four out of the five permanent members of the UN security council (the US, Russia, China and France, with the exception of Britain) will conduct high-profile elections that will distract attention and curtail their engagement in international affairs.<br>The prime example is the United States, where Obama will seek a second presidential term in November. Already he is cutting his foreign policy cloth to suit his political ambitions. His recent hyperbolic celebration of American &quot;success&quot; in Iraq, marking the fulfilment of his pledge to end the war and bring the troops home, was aimed directly at middle America voters. Never mind that Iraq's political tensions remain acute. A spate of bombings before Christmas raised fears of renewed sectarian conflict.<br>Obama's 2012 campaign will probably lack the uplifting motifs of four years ago. He will concentrate on defending his record and portraying the Republicans as a dangerous threat. As matters stand, his most likely opponent is Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich, both seasoned machine politicians whose lack of new ideas is matched only by their lack of charisma. With the US economy in the tank and election-year unemployment at its highest for several decades, it's going to be close.<br>Managed democracy<br>Elections (of a kind) are also due in China and Russia. Until recent mass street protests over fraudulent parliamentary polls disrupted the plan, Vladimir Putin was expected to be effortlessly enthroned as Russia's president in March. Putin is still odds-on to win – but the shine has gone off his particular red star. A third Putin presidency now presages a period of ever more chauvinistic nationalism and increased domestic confrontation. It is not yet a second Russian revolution – but it warrants careful attention.<br>In Beijing, the Communist party's October conference, barring unexpected earthquakes, will appoint empty-space apparatchik Xi Jinping as general-secretary and prospective successor to chief empty-space, President Hu Jintao. Continuity will be the watchword.<br>But China faces increasing internal, economy-related turbulence and a world market whose appetite for its exports has sharply contracted. Its new military-diplomatic assertiveness across the Asia-Pacific region is also producing a backlash among neighbours. Watch out for escalating territorial and resource disputes in the South and East China seas.<br>French disconnection<br>Last but not least, the voluble, vituperative French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, will seek a second term in spring polls that pit him against the socialist-lite candidate, François Hollande, centrist François Bayrou, and the far-right standard-bearer, Marine Le Pen.<br>Sarkozy will run on a France-first, Gaullist style platform, abandoning his previous reformist message. He will be judged primarily on his handling of the eurozone crisis and its negative impact on the French economy and jobs.<br>Cutting government spending, though seemingly unavoidable, remains a big taboo.

Candidates who have dropped out of the presidential race since then have been marked with an asterisk and their comments have been moved to the bottom of the section. Latest updates marked “NEW.”<br>A crowded field of candidates has sought to challenge Donald Trump in the 2020 American presidential election: In May 2019, 23 Democrats and two Republicans, including the incumbent, had announced their candidacy.

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">The Comey firing is rightly dominating the news. Amazingly, though, it wasn’t the only major development in the ongoing and intensifying Trump-Russia scandal.<br>The official reason for FBI Director Jim Comey’s dismissal is that he mishandled the Hillary Clinton email investigation, something many Democrats surely agree with. But the more convincing explanation is that Comey had infuriated the president by having the FBI launch a formal criminal probe into the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russia.<br>But the Comey story buried other huge Russia-related developments that came to light yesterday and this morning that you should really be following. What follows is a quick guide to what you need to know to stay on top of what happened — and why it all matters.<br>Tuesday night: federal prosecutors subpoena associates of Michael Flynn<br>Last night, CNN dropped a bombshell: Federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas to colleagues close to Michael Flynn, Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser, asking for business records.<br>This is a really big deal. The investigation into Flynn’s ties with Russia has been ongoing since July, but this is indicates the probe is picking up steam and that prosecutors may be growing more confident that there’s enough out there to build a criminal case against the disgraced retired general. The focus appears to be on Flynn’s business relationships with people in Russia and Turkey.<br>That makes sense. Flynn already has a shady record with his own disclosures, financial and otherwise, and they involve exactly those two countries. He didn’t reveal a $45,000 payment for giving a speech in Moscow from Russia Today, a government-run news channel seen by many in the United States as a propaganda arm of the Putin regime. Flynn sat comfortably next to Vladimir Putin at the gala where he delivered his remarks.<br>After he was fired by Trump, Flynn revealed he was paid $500,000 to work as a foreign agent representing Turkish interests. He had not disclosed that information to the Justice Department.<br>Flynn also famously lied to Vice President Mike Pence about discussing US sanctions against Russia with Moscow’s Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before the administration began. After news of that came out, Trump finally fired Flynn, who now holds the record for shortest tenure as national security adviser at 24 days.<br>It’s unclear what, if anything, the investigators will find. Frankly, asking for subpoenas is a common step in any investigation.<br>But that’s why this story is so big. Flynn was a close Trump associate who became one of the most powerful people in Washington, and investigators feel the need to take this routine step to keep investigating him. In other words, there is a there there, and so the investigators want to keep digging.<br>Fake news this is not.<br>Also Tuesday night: Senate investigators ask Treasury to look for any financial ties between Team Trump and Russia<br>To paraphrase Lester Freamon from The Wire, if you follow the money, you don’t know where it might lead you.

 scoffs when asked by @mitchellreports about effect of Comey's firing on DC mtgs. pic.twitter.com/SCFJzGsYQZ — NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) May 10, 2017<br>That America and Russia have a lot to talk about would be an understatement. The wars in Ukraine and Syria are already on the docket, as are the bilateral relations between the two countries. They surely also chatted about Russia’s support for the Taliban in Afghanistan, fighting ISIS, and — oh, yeah — that whole Russia-potentially-meddling-in-the-US-election thing.<br>Lavrov has been Russia’s foreign minister since March 2004. He’s the hard-drinking, heavy-smoking leader with close ties to Putin. Putin will be very interested in what goes on in Lavrov’s two meetings with Tillerson and Trump.<br>The optics of this could not be worse. But then again, this is the same administration that did not expect any sort of political blowback from the Comey firing.<br>In the context of everyday American politics, the past 24 hours — which included a president firing the very person investigating him and his administration — were truly remarkable. It’s the type of day that would have been unthinkable in any other administration. The fact that it was in some ways just a normal day for the Trump White House is the most alarming thing of all.</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">On Dec. 7, Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs held an event titled “25 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union: What Comes Next?” Below are some highlights of the speakers’ presentations.<br>Context: This discussion examined the collapse of the Soviet Union through the lens of “applied history”—an explicit attempt to illuminate current challenges and policy choices by analyzing historical precedents and analogues. Two of the speakers, Graham Allison and Niall Ferguson, co-direct the Belfer Center’s Applied History Project; the other two, Mary Elise Sarotte and Arne Westad, are members of the project’s working group. As Prof. Allison noted in his opening remarks, the Soviet Union ceased to exist only 25 years ago, so it may be premature to draw conclusions from the developments that have unfolded since then; however, on Jan. 20, 2017, a new U.S. administration will take office and it will be making choices about Russia policy, so historians should contribute to that decision-making right now, not wait another 25 years.<br>Speakers:<br>Highlights (summarized and paraphrased, not verbatim):<br>The presentations were followed by a question-and-answer session that touched on: Yeltsin’s failure to dismantle the Communist Party and the KGB/FSB; the idea that the U.S. is bounded by multilateral institutions, while Russia can act unilaterally; values versus interests; Ukraine; Western Europe; Syria; and more.<br>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Twenty-five years ago at the first U.S.-Russian Summit meeting in Washington, D.C., presidents George H. W. Bush and Boris Yeltsin sealed an unprecedented agreement, symbolizing and catalyzing the tectonic events at the end of the Cold War. Both presidents took significant—almost implausible—risks. The United States agreed to provide aid to institutions that had targeted America and its allies with nuclear, chemical and biological weapons—albeit to assist with the destruction or improved security of those arsenals. Russia agreed to admit its former enemies to its most sensitive facilities, once the heart of the Soviet Union’s defenses—literally its secret cities.<br>In the retrospective glow of success, it is easy to see the June 1992 “Umbrella Agreement” establishing cooperative threat reduction programs between the United States and Russia as inevitable, but it was not. In broad terms, it required imagination from academics and experts who conceived it, courage from legislators and diplomats who enacted, funded and codified it and practical solutions from the scientists and technicians who implemented it. Had any one of these groups failed to step forward, the effort would have failed—with potentially catastrophic consequences. Moreover, all of the creators of the Umbrella Agreement acted in an era still fraught with mutual distrust and uncertainty.<br>Only five years earlier, in June 1987,

<br>For over 20 years, the United States and the Russian Federation acted in close concert to improve the security of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable materials at nearly 150 sites in Russia and in dozens of other countries.  They also improved border controls, redirected scientists with weapons expertise, shut down plutonium-production reactors and converted 500 metric tons of Russian highly enriched uranium to reactor fuel, which for years provided about 10% of American electricity, turning megatons to megawatts. It was a program of remarkable achievement, which indisputably made the world safer.<br>Moreover, these efforts enjoyed consistent support through leadership changes in both countries, and despite acrimony in other realms. President George H. W. Bush signed the initial cooperative threat reduction legislation authored by Sens. Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar. President Bill Clinton gave shape and detail to the effort, essentially outlining all of the programs that would eventually be implemented. After the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush doubled funding for the efforts, increasing their scope and pace. President Barack Obama further broadened the span of activities with the Nuclear Security Summits.<br>Equally in Russia, successive leaders supported cooperative threat reduction efforts.  President Boris Yeltsin had the courage and foresight to sign the Umbrella Agreement.  President Vladimir Putin, with President George W. Bush, launched the Bratislava Initiative, which set December 31, 2008, as the deadline for completing physical security upgrades in Russia, and increased the number of facilities within the scope of work.  President Dmitry Medvedev attended the first two Nuclear Security Summits.<br>This constructive continuity broke formally in November 2014, when Russia informed the United States that it would curtail cooperative threat reduction efforts by refusing to approve any new nuclear security projects in 2015.  Moscow also announced a boycott of the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit. To be sure, the considerable improvement in Russian nuclear security, and the need to transform what had been a donor-recipient relationship into a partnership of equals, argued for revamping cooperative efforts. Nonetheless, their effective end within Russia leaves both countries less secure than they otherwise would be.<br>Russia’s seizure of Crimea and use of force in eastern Ukraine, and the resulting Western sanctions on Moscow, have also taken a toll on cooperation.

 as reasons for suspending Russian participation in an agreement to dispose of 34 metric tons each of U.S. and Russian military plutonium. Thus, whether or not the once vibrant U.S.-Russian cooperation on nuclear security can be rebuilt remains highly uncertain.<br>What is certain is that the threats to nuclear security continue to be real and urgent in Russia and elsewhere. Al-Qaeda and Chechen rebels both plotted acts of nuclear terrorism, and members of both groups remain active. The Islamic State shares al-Qaeda’s nihilism, but managed to amass substantially more territory, people, expertise and resources, even if they are now under sustained attack. In about two dozen cases over as many years, weapons-grade fissile material has been seized outside of authorized control, including cases in 2003, 2006, 2010 and 2011—incontrovertible evidence of nuclear security failure. Organized crime and corruption continue to beset Russia, including at nuclear facilities, and there are reports of the spread of radical Islam to Siberia and the Urals region, home to many of Russia’s nuclear weapons sites.<br>To address these threats effectively will require that the current set of American and Russian leaders demonstrate as much courage and creativity as did their predecessors in the 90s and naughts.

In this regard, some may see the events recounted differently, which offers the opportunity for dialectic improvement. Still, the story of the bombs that did not go off and the terrorist attacks that did not occur deserves to be told and understood and thus the timeline is an important contribution.<br>1991<br>July 31, 1991.

<br>September 27, 1991. President Bush, in an unprecedented unilateral move, announces the first round of PNIs that entail the withdrawal from Europe of all ground-launched and about half of naval tactical nuclear weapons to central storage facilities in the U.S. and their subsequent destruction, as well as de-alerting strategic nuclear systems. Bush also advances a proposal for eliminating ICBMs with multiple warheads (MIRVs), which eventually (in a modified form) becomes the START-II treaty. Bush suggests that the U.S. and USSR explore cooperation on safe and secure nuclear warhead command and control, storage, transport, dismantlement and destruction.<br>October 5, 1991. Gorbachev announces that the Soviet Union will reciprocate Bush’s PNIs on non-strategic nuclear weapons and de-alerting a portion of the ICBM force and, further, proposes to eliminate an entire category of non-strategic nuclear weapons. Gorbachev declares a one-year moratorium on nuclear testing and urges the U.S. to do the same. He also proposes a no-first-use declaration by all nuclear powers.<br>October 7, 1991.

 that civil war is imminent if the Soviet Union disintegrates.<br>October 18-24, 1991. A Soviet delegation, headed by Deputy Minister of Atomic Power and Industry Viktor Mikhailov, visits Washington, D.C. on the invitation of the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) and the National Resource Defense Council (NRDC) and meets with U.S. government officials and congressmen. Mikhailov assesses that if the Soviet Union is to destroy the 15,000 nuclear warheads earmarked for dismantlement under START and the PNIs over the next 7-9 years, it would require $2 billion just for new storage facilities. He urges Congress to fund a $400 million effort to assist Russia with dismantling nuclear weapons that would later become known as the Nunn-Lugar initiative.<br>October 24, 1991. Thomas Neff, an MIT physicist, publishes an op-ed in the New York Times titled “A Grand Uranium Bargain,” suggesting that, in order to facilitate the disarmament process, the U.S. should buy or barter fissile material released from the Russian warheads slotted for dismantlement. Neff embarks on actively promoting the idea with the U.S. government.<br>October 1991. A U.S.-Russian working group on Safety, Security and Dismantlement (SSD) of Nuclear Weapons is established to facilitate the rapid and safe implementation of the PNIs.

 that the destiny of the 27,000 nuclear weapons on the territory of the uncertain Soviet Union is a paramount security concern. The report identifies three challenges: devolution of control over nuclear weapons to constituent republics, unauthorized seizure or use and proliferation of weapons and sensitive materials outside the Soviet Union. The authors recommend prompt implementation of PNIs and U.S. technical cooperation in transport, storage, disablement and dismantling of nuclear weapons and sensitive weapon-related components.”<br>November 13, 1991.

 Due to strong opposition to aid to the Soviet Union, however, Nunn is forced to withdraw the Nunn-Aspin bill. Despite this, Nunn proceeds to build bipartisan support for the idea by engaging Sen. Richard Lugar (R-In.) and others.<br>November 15, 1991. Sens. Nunn and Lugar meet with Sergei Rogov and Andrei Kokoshin of the Institute for U.S. and Canadian Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (ISKAN); the Russians warn that nuclear weapons could be caught in a power struggle between the Soviet republics.<br>November 19, 1991. Ashton Carter presents the results of the Belfer Center’s “Soviet Nuclear Fission” study to Sens. Nunn and Lugar and their staff. William Perry of Stanford University, John Steinbruner of Brookings Institution and David Hamburg of the Carnegie Corporation also attend the meeting.<br>November 21, 1991. Nunn invites 16 senators from both parties for a breakfast meeting where he and Carter brief them on the nuclear threat posed by the Soviet collapse. The senators give their approval to the Nunn-Lugar initiative to assist the Soviet Union with dismantling nuclear arms.<br>November 25, 1991. President Bush submits the START Treaty to the Senate for ratification.<br>November 25-27, 1991. The first round of U.S.-Soviet SSD talks take place in Washington, D.C., led by Undersecretary Bartholomew and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Alexei Obukhov. The sides broach discussions of safety, security and dismantlement of nuclear weapons per the PNIs. The head of the U.S. SSD working group, Amb. Courtney, relates a sense of urgency in rapid disablement of nuclear weapons slotted for destruction, citing risks of instability, armed conflict and accidental missile launch in the USSR. Courtney’s Soviet counterpart, Sergei Zelentsov, chief engineer of the Defense Ministry directorate in charge of security of nuclear weapons, does not share the U.S. sense of urgency and remains skeptical about the need for U.S. assistance.<br>November 27, 1991. The Senate, in an 86-8 vote, passes the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act, authorizing the appropriation of $500 million from the Department of Defense (DoD) budget for Fiscal Year 1992, of which $100 million are designated for humanitarian assistance and $400 million for assisting with dismantling nuclear and chemical weapons in the Soviet Union.

 over nuclear weapons. The Belavezha Accords, as the agreement becomes known, are ratified by the Ukrainian and Belarusian parliaments on December 10 and by the Russian parliament on December 12, 1991.<br>December 12, 1991. Secretary of State James Baker delivers an address at Princeton University outlining U.S. policy toward transformations in the Soviet Union. Baker declares that the U.S. does not want to see new nuclear states emerge and expects that Soviet nuclear weapons will remain under a common, unified command and control.<br>December 12, 1991. President Bush signs the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act into Public Law No. 102-228. Later, the program will be renamed Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR). The law specifies the following objectives:<br>Congress, however, requires the executive branch to certify that the recipient of the Nunn-Lugar funds:<br>Congress authorizes but does not appropriate the $400 million for the program. These funds would have to be reprogrammed from existing DoD Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M) accounts for FY92. The same pattern would be repeated for FY93.<br>December 1991. At an early interagency meeting on implementing the CTR legislation, the DoD general counsel Jack Beard proposes a way for the executive branch to meet the recipient-certification requirements included in the legislation. That approach would be followed every year until Congress lifted the certification requirements under the George W. Bush administration.<br>December 15-21, 1991. Secretary of State Baker visits the four Soviet republics where strategic nuclear arms are deployed—Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia. He reiterates the U.S. position that no new nuclear states should emerge from the Soviet collapse and a single, collective command and control authority over the strategic nuclear weapons should be preserved.<br>December 16-20, 1991. U.S. and Soviet scientists from government- and public-sector organizations hold workshops in Moscow and Kyiv on Soviet warhead dismantlement and the best use of the $400 million authorized under the Nunn-Lugar act. The Soviet Ministry of Atomic Power and Industry (MAPI) presents a proposal to use the funds for the construction of a plutonium-storage facility under joint “safeguards.”<br>December 16, 1991. At a retreat in Leesburg, Virgina, Secretary of Energy Admiral James Watkins and the directors of the U.S. nuclear labs discuss ways to help Soviet nuclear scientists and prevent brain drain from the former Soviet Union. They decide that the lab directors should engage with their Russian counterparts. The ensuing series of exchanges and programs, many funded by CTR, become known as lab-to-lab cooperation.<br>December 21, 1991. The CIS holds a summit in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan, at which eight more Soviet republics join the grouping: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine also sign the Agreement on Joint Measures on Nuclear Weapons, whereby Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus pledge to withdraw all tactical nuclear weapons to Russia by July 1, 1992, and Ukraine and Belarus to eliminate strategic nuclear weapons on their territories by 1994 and join the international Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as non-nuclear-weapons states. CIS members agree that Russia should succeed the USSR as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. CIS member further elaborate the constitution of joint strategic forces and the decision-making process for nuclear use at a meeting in Minsk on December 30.<br>December 25, 1991. At 7 p.m. local time, in a televised address, Gorbachev resigns as president and commander-in-chief of the USSR. Immediately afterward, he transfers his “nuclear suitcase” to Russian President Yeltsin.<br>The Soviet flag is lowered over the Kremlin and replaced with the Russian tricolor.

<br>December 26, 1991. The upper house of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR passes a declaration recognizing that due to the establishment of the CIS, the USSR ceases to exist and disbands itself.<br>The dissolution of the Soviet Union leaves 25% of the ex-country’s ICBM force and 40% of its long-range strategic bomber force outside the territory of the Russian Federation. Ukraine inherits 176 silo-based ICMBs, 130 SS-19s and 46 SS-24s, each armed with multiple warheads, for a total of some 1,240 strategic warheads, 44 strategic bombers armed with almost 588 air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) and some 2,600 tactical nuclear weapons. Belarus inherits 81 land-mobile SS-25 ICBMs each armed with a single warhead and over 1,000 tactical nuclear weapons. Kazakhstan inherits 104 SS-18 silo-based ICBMs armed with a total of 1,040 warheads and 40 strategic aircraft armed with 370 ALCMs. All three former Soviet republics also inherit significant elements of the former Soviet nuclear research and production complex. In addition, Russia has an estimated inventory of 1,300 metric tons of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and somewhere between 120 and 170 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium located at some 60 sites in hundreds of buildings.1<br>1992<br>January 15-20, 1992. Undersecretary Bartholomew leads the first interagency delegation to Moscow, Kyiv, Minsk and Alma-Ata,2 now capitals of the newly independent states, to discuss arms control, including the ratification and implementation of START, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) and the NPT. Bartholomew mentions that the U.S. has funds, under the Nunn-Lugar program, to aid with weapons dismantlement, once the specific needs of the new states are better defined. Bartholomew also conducts another round of SSD talks in Moscow where the Russian side reiterates that the main bottleneck in the Russian process of dismantling warheads is lack of a fissile-materials storage facility.<br>January 28, 1992. President Bush in his State of the Union address announces a second installment of PNIs that entail the cancellation of development, production and procurement of certain strategic nuclear system programs. Bush further elaborates proposals for the START-II de-MIRV’ing treaty.<br>January 29, 1992. President Yeltsin responds with reciprocal measures to Bush’s new PNIs, making specific commitments on the destruction of ground, naval and air non-strategic nuclear weapons, as well as a halt in production of a number of strategic nuclear systems.<br>January 29, 1992. President Yeltsin decrees to establish the Ministry of Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation, or Minatom, which oversees most of the Russian nuclear complex.<br>February 1, 1992.

 Bush and Yeltsin also conclude the Agreement Concerning the Safe and Secure Transportation, Storage and Destruction of Weapons and the Prevention of Weapons Proliferation, or SSD agreement for short. The agreement sets for a seven-year period the general framework for CTR-funded projects. The U.S. and Russia initial three CTR implementing agreements: on provision of armored blankets, on fissile-material containers and on nuclear accident response equipment.<br>July 2, 1992. The parliament of Kazakhstan ratifies START I and the Lisbon Protocol.<br>July 1992. The first shipment of 200 sets of armored blankets for warhead transportation arrives in Moscow from U.S. army storage depots in Europe. By June 1993, the U.S. would deliver some 700 sets of armored blankets.<br>July 1992. The U.S. and Russia sign an implementing agreement “Concerning Safe, Secure and Ecologically Sound Destruction of Chemical Weapons,” initially committing $25 million of CTR funds to the project.<br>August 28, 1992. DoD’s John Birely and Minatom’s Mikhailov sign an implementing agreement on the provision conversion kits to modify up to 100 cargo railcars and 15 guard railcars to enhance physical security of nuclear warheads and materials during transportation, pledging $20 million in CTR funds. Subsequently, a sample Soviet railcar is shipped to SNL in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for development of prototype conversion kits.<br>September 23, 1992. The U.S. conducts its last underground nuclear test.<br>October 1, 1992. The U.S. Senate ratifies START I.<br>October 2, 1992.

A joint U.S.-Russian team complete the design by June 1993.<br>October 22, 1992. The U.S. and Belarus sign a CTR umbrella agreement and two implementing documents: one on the provision of emergency-response equipment and associated training with $5 million of CTR funds committed; and another for setting up and equipping an export-control system for identifying and controlling nuclear materials worth $1 million.<br>October 26, 1992. Belarus announces that it has finalized the schedule for the withdrawal of SS-25 units from its territory. The withdrawal would conclude in November 1996.<br>November 4, 1992. The Russian Duma ratifies START I and the Lisbon Protocol, but makes its entry into force conditional on the accession to the NPT of Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus.<br>November 27, 1992. Russia, the U.S., Japan and the European Union sign an agreement on the establishment of the International Technology and Science Center (ITSC) in Moscow. ITSC’s mission is to provide research support for weapons scientists in Russia and the former Soviet Union to engage in peaceful civilian science projects.

Harvard’s Allison, Carter and others publish a report entitled “Cooperative Denuclearization: From Pledges to Deeds,” in which they argue that increased urgency and immediate assistance are needed to achieve safe disarmament in Russia and denuclearization of the non-Russian republics. Nuclear dangers created by the dissolution of the Soviet Union, including unauthorized launch, accident or illicit sale of a warhead, cannot be deterred in the traditional sense and can be tackled only by cooperative engagement with the former Soviet states that are undergoing profound political, economic and societal transformation. The report offers detailed policy recommendations on all aspects of the U.S.-Russian nuclear relationship, including arms control and nuclear security.<br>January 1993. The U.S. and Belarus sign an implementation treaty for a CTR-funded project to equip with communications systems and train the personnel of the Belarusian National Agency for Arms Control and Inspections.<br>January 3, 1993. Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton sign START II, a treaty that bans all ICBMs with multiple, independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) and makes further reductions to between 3,000 and 3,500 deployed nuclear warheads on each side. START II never enters into force.<br>January 13, 1993. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is opened for signature. By the end of the month both the U.S. and Russia sign on. The CWC would enter into force on April 29, 1997, obligating parties to eliminate all chemical weapons stockpiles within a decade, which in the U.S. amounted to approximately 30,000 tons and in Russia to some 40,000 tons of chemical agents.<br>February 4, 1993. The Belarusian parliament votes to ratify START and the Lisbon Protocol and accede to the NPT.<br>February 18, 1993. The head of the U.S. SSD delegation, Gen. Burns, and Russian Atomic Energy Minister Mikhailov sign in Washington a U.S.-Russian agreement on the disposition of the HEU extracted from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons. The agreement, based on the idea conceived by Tom Neff in 1991, provides a framework for the U.S. purchase of 500 metric tons of HEU from Russia, to be first blended down to low-enriched uranium at the facilities in Russia and then transferred to the U.S. for use in nuclear-power reactor fuel.<br>March, 1993. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher pledges $65 million in CTR funds to Belarus to assist with its denuclearization.<br>March, 1993. Three CTR implementation agreements with Russia are finalized:<br>The agreements are submitted for review to the relevant Russian ministries.<br>March 24, 1993.

<br>November 16, 1994. The Ukrainian parliament votes to have Ukraine accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapons state.<br>November 20-21, 1994. In a secret U.S.-Kazakhstani operation code-named “Project Sapphire,” two U.S. C-5 cargo planes airlift 600 kg of HEU from Ulba Metallurgical Plant in Ust-Kamenogorsk in northern Kazakhstan to DoE’s Oak Ridge facility in Tennessee. These C-5 nonstop flights (with three air-to-air refuelings) from Ust-Kamenogorsk to Dover AFB become the longest in history. Kazakhstan is compensated with about $20 million in CTR funds, as well as in non-cash assistance, for the value of the removed HEU.<br>December 5, 1994. At a summit of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Budapest, Hungary, the U.S., Russia, the UK and Ukraine sign a memorandum on security assurances in connection with Ukraine’s accession to the NPT.

Pursuant to Ukraine’s submission of NPT ratification instruments, START enters into force.<br>December 16, 1994. Minatom’s Mikhailov and U.S. Secretary of Energy Hazel O’Leary sign the Warhead Safety and Security Exchange Agreement (WSSX). The agreement provides guidelines for cooperation to enhance the safety and security of nuclear warheads in Russia. The agreement will enter into force on June 1, 1995. The program results in a series of working groups, seminars, and exchanges between U.S. and Russian nuclear labs, especially SNL and VNIIA.5 This collaboration yields the design and provision to Russian nuclear warhead storage sites of equipment for mitigating accident consequences and providing authenticated monitoring and control, some of which was funded by CTR.<br>December 1994. USEC places the first order for LEU blended down from 6 metric tons of HEU, the maximum Russia is able to process for delivery in 1995.<br>FY1994. The Clinton administration decides to include funding for CTR programs as a separate title in DoE's budget and State's budget.<br>1994. DoE establishes the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP) program with the objective of attracting U.S. businesses to laboratories and institutes of the former Soviet Union, with technology evaluations from the U.S. nuclear labs. IPP, which started operation as Industrial Partnership Program in 1992, received $35 million in FY94 appropriations.<br>1995<br>January 1995. The U.S. DoD and Russia’s Minatom agree to add $20 million in CTR funds for joint MPC&amp;A upgrades. Similar agreements are signed with Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Ukraine. Eventually, the two sides agree to cooperate on MPC&amp;A upgrades at five locations: Institute of Physics and Power Engineering in Obninsk, NIIAR in Dmitrovgrad, NPO Luch in Podolsk, Mayak Chemical Metallurgical Combine in Ozersk (formerly Chelyabinsk-65) and Production Association Machine Building Plant in Elektrostal.6 Due to secrecy concerns and limited access to Russian HEU facilities, however, only $1.5 million of the dedicated funds are spent by mid-1995.<br>February 1995.  Demonstrations are held at the first two facilities that completed MPC&amp;A upgrades, at Building 116 of the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow and at VNIIEF in Sarov.<br>March 1, 1995.

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">A quarter century has passed since the Soviet Union broke apart. In the early 1990s, it seemed like there was no place for America and Russia to wind up except on the same side. But today, tensions between the two have grown so high that talk of a new Cold War is all but constant.<br>Recently Georgetown University’s Center for Eurasian, Russian and Eastern European Studies1 gathered together top experts on U.S.-Russia ties to explore the lessons learned, the role of diplomatic and commercial relations and the possibilities for improving a crucial bilateral relationship.<br>As bad as tensions in U.S.-Russian relations have become, there are some key differences between now and the Cold War, according to Pulitzer Prize-winning author and political scientist William Taubman, who was one of the first to speak at the conference: The standoff is much less ideological, or at least the ideological contradictions are different (and perhaps less explicitly stated) than the old ones; it is not as global; and it does not seem to pose—at least not yet—the danger of nuclear Armageddon. Prof. Taubman also shared his impression that the hostility toward America is now deeper in Russian society than at the end of the Cold War, with much less admiration for America than in those heady days.<br>The summaries below focus primarily on the speakers’ presentations and not the question-answer sessions that followed. The latter, however, are included in the full video of each session, which can be viewed via the hyperlinks. All summaries are paraphrased, not verbatim, except where quotation marks indicate otherwise. Comments in parentheses have been added by the rapporteur.<br>Introduction<br>Full video (56:45)<br>Any serious discussion of U.S.-Russian relations since the fall of the Soviet Union must consider the nature of bilateral ties before that milestone event. This historical context was provided by Prof. Taubman who spoke about the different stages of the Cold War, focusing on U.S. and Soviet leaders, who may not be

 Prof. Taubman identified four stages of the Soviet-American standoff:<br>Session 1: 25 Years of Lessons Learned and Unlearned<br>Full video (1:40:47)<br>This session focused on the 1990s and most of the presenters spoke to some extent about the surprises, mistakes and missed opportunities of those years, as well as the decade and a half since. The conversation also included some disagreement about the West’s efforts to integrate Russia into its institutions after the Cold War.<br>The main surprises identified by specific speakers:<br>One of the most interesting disagreements during the session concerned the post-Cold War order, particularly in the realm of international security, and the ways Russia’s place in that order was determined. The bluntest negative assessment came from Dr. Sergey Rogov, former director and now academic dean of the Institute for U.S. and Canadian Studies of the Russian Academy of Science: When Russia was weak and disoriented after the Soviet collapse, America made

 The dissenting opinion came from Amb. Vershbow, who started the first of his three NATO assignments in the summer of 1991, later served as ambassador to Russia and was most recently deputy secretary general of NATO. He believes NATO enlargement was not a mistake and that the U.S. and its allies tried hard to pull Russia into an inclusive security system, inventing 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

 NATO enlargement a political, not a military, project.<br>Dr. Graham, who served on the National Security Council from 2002 to 2007, cited two examples of policies that might have been enacted differently, saying there was a time when President Putin wanted an equal partnership, and Russia had grown strong enough to be a constructive partner, but the U.S. didn’t take the risks necessary to test how willing he was to reciprocate, though it could have afforded those risks as the stronger of the two countries. Dr. Graham’s “what if” scenarios: (1) What if Washington had allowed Moscow a greater role in restoring Afghanistan, where the two had worked very closely in the initial phases of the U.S.-led war and America even used Russian intelligence? And (2) what if talks in the NATO-Russia Council had been a genuinely open discussion of equals, instead of Washington deciding that NATO should find a unified position and present it to Russia?

<br>In closing, all the speakers tried to touch on lessons learned and ways forward. Dr. Graham saw three lessons looking back: (1) The U.S. needed to show more respect for Russian power; (2) never underestimate Russia’s willingness to defend its national interests; (3) we always need to imagine that we might be wrong in our assumptions and our policy prescriptions and always have to be willing to go back and readjust. Prof. Legvold said neither side ever focused enough on the stakes in the bilateral relationship: In a world of nine countries with nuclear weapons (and several more with the strong potential to develop them), climate change and other major transnational problems, some form of partnership is imperative.

 (He served as Russia’s foreign minister from 1998 to 2004; Ms. Albright was U.S. secretary of state from 1997 to 2001.)<br>The biggest challenges the two grappled with in their time as counterparts had been in the Balkans—at a time that included the 1999 U.S. bombing of Belgrade—and with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which Washington had considered abandoning (and did in 2001). In both instances, the personal rapport between the two diplomats helped mitigate the fallout. Mr. Ivanov recalled getting an unexpected evening phone call from “Madeleine” as he was having dinner with his family;

 International organizations are not solving existing problems, posing the risk of greater disorder.<br>Both also noted how much harder the next generation of diplomats will have it, as the field of international relations has come to require a knowledge of everything from economy and nuclear weapons to space and cyber security.<br>Session 2: The Role of the Private Sector and Commercial Relations<br>Full video (01:39:27)<br>This session brought together one Russian political scientist and four American businessmen who have been working in Russia for the last 20-25 years and have, between them, directed about $6 billion in investments into the country by the session chair’s estimate. These entrepreneurs have collectively helped create major businesses that are now household names in Russia, like the telecoms company Vympelcom, Yandex (known as Russia’s Google), online seller Avito, TV networks CTC and MTV-Russia and medical-services providers InVitro, European Medical Center and Mat’ i Detya. They spoke of their ties to Russia, the role foreign investment has played in its economy and the country’s economic outlook as they see it.<br>Session chair Daniel Russell of the U.S.-Russia Business Council kicked things off with five basic points:<br>Next, Feodor Voitolovsky of the Primakov Institute of World Economy and International Relations described the historical background of U.S.-Russian economic relations, giving a play by play of the entire Soviet and post-Soviet period. He made three main points: (1) Political motivations have largely trumped economic ones in U.S. economic policy toward Russia; (2) bilateral economic relations have gone through alternating periods of positive and negative; (3) but with trade ties as weak as they are, economic interdependencies have never become a buffer against political frictions between Moscow and Washington, as they did, more or less, in the U.S.-China relationship or in Russia’s pre-Ukraine ties with the EU. Dr. Voitolovsky noted that while U.S. investment in Russia circa 1987-1993 was small in absolute numbers, it was very significant in helping develop market principles—a point on which the other speakers generally agreed.<br>

 that Russia’s economic recovery will be slow, but still felt the country’s a good investment for at least three reasons: (1) Russia’s experiencing the same long-term change as economies all over the world, with online commerce and

 growing very fast, including the ways businesses are finding customers; (2) inflation is coming down to single digits for the first time since he’s been there; (3) industries that are well developed in other parts of the world, like insurance, are in their infancy in Russia and have huge potential there as the bank rate changes and investors look for better returns on their money. Mr. Calvey noted that when he and the other speakers started out, people in Russia didn’t believe you could make money from a company’s shares, but foreign investors have changed that: They have shown that you can make money off a company by keeping money in it, not

 that private equity money is very long-term, especially in Russia, which has less liquidity than the U.S. and capital markets that don’t work as well. Up until the Ukraine crisis in 2014, the returns on those private investments were excellent,

 Today there’s a kind of pause, a break in the action. Interest in Russia is muted—partly because of the politics, partly due to lack of meaningful structural reform, which is unlikely until after Russian elections in 2018. Mr. Guff agreed with Mr. Calvey that the biggest returns in Russia, like in China, India and other emerging markets, are going to come from technology and the shift to a digital economy—how people search for things, pay for things, etc.<br>Peter O'Brien, a former CFO of Russian oil giant Rosneft and an independent director at pipe manufacturer TMK, expressed the half-optimistic, half-whimsical hope that low oil prices would actually force through some of the changes needed to make Russia’s economy more amenable to foreign investment, after the 2018 elections at least. He also pointed out that all strong industries have their natural life cycles, mentioning an oil executive who had always been very bullish on Russia but recently shut down his office, saying that with these oil prices he could do better economically in the U.S.

, compromise may be difficult as there’s a view that certain kinds of conduct by Russia make moving forward difficult.<br>Andrei Kortunov of the Russian International Affairs Council pointed to a roadmap for U.S.-Russia relations that he recently co-edited with Olga Oliker from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

 is essentially inherited from the last century, including issues we failed to resolve, or swept under the rug, and now it’s come back. The major items there are the arms race/arms control and non-proliferation; it offers an important stimulus for cooperation, but we must fix it and move ahead. The “new” agenda involves emerging problems and opportunities: climate change, migration management, international terrorism, global governance, including the reform of international institutions like the U.N., food security and the Arctic. There are entirely different groups of stakeholders on both sides. Again, there will be clashes of interests, but they’ll be different from those on the old agenda. We should try to balance the two.<br>Stefan Meister of the German Council on Foreign Relations gave the German perspective on Russia and U.S.-Russian relations, saying that German-Russian relations have also fallen to their lowest point in the post-Cold War period, with politics now dominant over economy in Russian-European relations—a big change. The fundamental shift came after Ukraine, which has made it impossible for Germany to cooperate with Russia as allies, although both countries are

 about President Donald Trump—neither knows what he wants. Presidents Putin and Trump both mistrust international institutions and want only deals among big powers, Dr. Meister said, adding that the Russian leadership is missing an opportunity to re-engage with Germany because Moscow believes European elections will improve its position anyway. Russia is focusing on the big picture of a new international framework, while the West is focusing on small steps. They’re needed.<br>Arkady Ostrovsky of The Economist magazine said that what we’re living through is not a return to the Cold War, but the result of the way it ended and how that end was perceived. We are really looking at a stand-off between liberalism and national-populism, which is not confined to any one country. Studying the end of the Cold War is relevant: Russia emerged from the Cold War with the thought that once Communism ended Russia would become

 But 1999—the year after Russia’s financial crisis (and the year the U.S. bombed Yugoslavia without either Russia’s or the U.N.’s support)— emphasized a disillusionment with reforms and their failure to deliver on promises, which was then sublimated into anti-Americanism. The rhetoric of

. If Russia was defeated, the logic suggests, it’s only natural that it would one day seek revenge. The end of the Cold War was a precursor to the far right we’re seeing now. Putin understood, not right away, but pretty early on, the importance of narratives and ideas. Putin and Trump are both over-the-top TV personalities who have used the media and narrative very powerfully, while liberals have given up the historic narrative, allowing the likes of nationalists to seize it.

 by the end of the year if the war continues.)<br>This global economic downturn will likely emerge as an increasingly influential factor in US/NATO decision-making—potentially opening up a rift between Europe, which may seek a swifter end to the war, and the United States, which wants to see Moscow suffer a full defeat.<br>So how could a frozen conflict play out globally over the next two years? Below are three variations on what this scenario might look like:<br>Scenario 1: Ukraine is slowly strangled<br>Russia consolidates its land bridge to the Kremlin-controlled Crimean Peninsula and, without securing complete control of the rest of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, destroys or blocks the port city of Odesa—leaving the country effectively landlocked. Putin continues to bomb infrastructure elsewhere across Ukraine and annexes parts of the south and east, further destabilizing the country as a fully functioning state. He declares 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    a “victory”

</mark>
 while successfully suppressing dissent at home.<br>The scenario could further play out like this:<br>Putin calls for a ceasefire in early 2023 but is not ready for a peace deal; he still hopes for greater land gains in the future (perhaps connecting to Moldova) as well as concessions from NATO (such as the recognition of Crimea as Russian sovereign territory if residents agree in an internationally supervised referendum). Western sanctions against Russia remain in place, and economic conditions there worsen. But the United States and Europe also plunge into recession, which fuels growing political discontent over inflation and shortages of goods.<br>A full-scale global food crisis results in spiraling riots and unrest from Sri Lanka to Egypt (where the knock-on effects of the war are already being felt), while trading patterns drastically deteriorate after major exporting nations such as India, Indonesia, and Malaysia double down on food protectionism. A slow response from the Group of Seven (G7) nations and the International Monetary Fund exacerbates the debt crisis facing developing nations. Instability grows in Africa and Asia, while leftist politicians surge in Latin America.<br>Further into 2023, NATO allies continue to send more lethal military aid as Ukraine—which refused Putin’s proposed ceasefire—tries to retake occupied territory. The quality and quantity of this aid tempts Moscow to continue disrupting supply flows into Ukraine, increasing the risk of attacks close to (or even on) NATO territory while widening the conflict between the Alliance and Russia.<br>By late 2023, Western consensus is fraying. Concerned by economic costs, Ukrainian suffering, refugee burdens, and fears of escalation (including the risk of a nuclear attack by Russia), Germany and France lead a multinational effort to press Kyiv to exploring a peace arrangement with Moscow.<br>Scenario 2: Russia makes no gains<br>Thanks to increasingly competent Ukrainian tactics—a continuation of those displayed during Kyiv’s defense of the capital, plus a successful counteroffensive in the eastern Donbas region—Russia is pushed back to pre-February 24 areas of control (retaining Crimea and the separatist-occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk) by early 2023. But further gains by Ukraine prove difficult because of entrenched Russian and separatist defenses. Despite Western shipments of more advanced arms, Ukrainian forces make minimal progress.<br>The scenario could further play out like this:<br>Facing growing discontent at home over a collapsing economy and an exhausted military angry over repeated operational failures, Putin is under heavy pressure to strike a deal with Ukraine before his hand worsens even more.<br>Starting in early 2023, Turkey, Qatar, and India—which since 2020 have sought to cast themselves as global peacemakers—press for a ceasefire as the global economic crisis stokes a sense of urgency. But emboldened by its success on the battlefield, Ukraine is resistant while Putin still hopes for a military comeback.<br>Meanwhile, some European leaders also start quietly pushing for a formal diplomatic framework: French President Emmanuel Macron teams up with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to call for talks in Geneva among Ukraine and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (which includes Russia), plus Germany (modeled on the 2+4 talks on German reunification) to find a solution. Xi and Macron privately try to persuade Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, respectively—dangling the promise of Russian reparations as part of a settlement. Beijing does not want to appear to be undercutting Putin’s plans, but China’s sputtering economy leaves Xi little choice.<br>Emboldened by a landslide Republican victory in the November 2022 midterm elections in the United States, a growing number of GOP legislators press for ending US military aid to Ukraine and refocusing Washington’s attention on Beijing as a leading security threat.<br>Scenario 3: Ukraine wins back nearly everything<br>As a result of significantly increased Western arms shipments to Ukraine, a collapse in Russian morale at both the tactical and strategic levels, and Moscow’s inability to replace military hardware at the levels needed (thanks to Western sanctions), Russia is pushed completely out of Ukraine except for Crimea, but Kyiv is gearing up to retake the peninsula (which Putin would effectively view as an invasion of Russian territory).<br>The scenario could further play out like this:<br>There is a growing risk of Russian nuclear retaliation to halt Western military aid, heightened by Russia’s loss of previously separatist-occupied eastern Ukraine. As Ukraine mounts a planned offensive to recover the Black Sea peninsula, Putin deploys Iskander-M (SS-26) nuclear-tipped missiles there and threatens to use them if Kyiv’s forces advance. Suddenly, World War III becomes a distinct possibility if urgent meditation efforts by France and China to avoid further escalation end in failure.<br>But by mid-2023—nearly an entire year before he’d hoped to engineer another reelection—Putin’s hold on power at home is threatened by spiraling public anger. Humiliated top military and intelligence officials force Putin to resign immediately but allow him to keep a nest egg and shield him from international prosecution for war crimes.<br>The United States and European Union differ over the question of lifting some sanctions against Russia: Fearing the prospect of a giant North Korea next door (in the form of a deeply isolated Russia), Europe seeks a bargain by relieving sanctions on oil, gas, and other commodities under a quid-pro-quo agreement that portions of the Russian sales be sent as reparations to a Ukraine reconstruction fund led by the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.<br>Global economic growth falters, reaching a meager 1 percent in 2023 amid increased beggar-thy-neighbor, 1930s-style protectionism, burgeoning nationalism that erodes global institutions, and popular discontent spreading from the United States and Europe to a seething developing world.<br>What happens next on the battlefield will determine whether the current largely frozen conflict will eventually advantage Russia or Ukraine. Various military outcomes are still plausible. With so many variables in play, it is difficult to attach probabilities to potential scenarios.<br>But in all cases, the economic damage will be profound not just for Ukraine, but also for the rest of the world. Instead of waiting for an outcome to the war, policymakers must urgently explore solutions to the global food crisis, the growing potential for debt crises in the developing world, and the threat of recession in the West. Meanwhile, the risk of Russia using nuclear weapons in the course of the conflict is not zero. Employing diplomatic means to avoid such an escalation is vital if the conflict is to remain contained and not envelop the entire world.<br>Mathew Burrows is the director of foresight at the Scowcroft Strategy Initiative and the co-director of the New American Engagement Initiative within the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security.

The gas attack killed dozens of people and injured hundreds. Syria has denied using chemical weapons in that attack.<br>

However, there’s a lot that isn’t obvious that may just be the key to understanding the current developments.<br>Though shaken in the early hours of the reported attacks, Russian decision-makers and the expert community eventually adopted a more restrained tone in considering reasons behind the US attack. For now, there are at least three theories.<br>1.

 The impetus for the attack may have been domestic, international or both. If it was the former, then it’s mostly about impressing the domestic constituency, fixing failing ratings, winning points with Congress and distancing himself from the image of the “Kremlin candidate.” If the impetus was about his international posturing, he had to send a clear message to America’s foes and allies: Please the Israelis, satisfy the Gulf, alert Iranians, warn North Koreans and strip Russians of the perception that they run the show.<br>The Kremlin was puzzled by this move from someone it had expected to be a partner against international terrorism. Thus came the reaction from Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova:

 In this hypothetical, the Syria strikes weren’t Trump’s decision. He might have been simply cornered by public pressure, as well as by Democrats and Republicans, to take action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He might have been tricked into believing that Assad alone was to blame for the gas attack, just after Trump had said he wasn’t opposed to the Syrian president remaining in power. In this narrative, the forced departure of Steven Bannon from the National Security Council signals a shift in the administration’s policy, and the Syria strikes were one result.<br>Another approach to this second narrative says the gas attacks were perpetrated by

 in Syria — whether this party is the United States or regional players. The behavior of Israel and Turkey in this respect is remarkable. Israel has long sought the destruction of the Syrian chemical arsenal. Turkey’s influence in Syria is fading, so it has quickly shifted from supporting the peace process with Russia and Iran to supporting the US military operation.<br>If these arguments are true, Trump is now closer to the hawkish tradition of the Republican right wing and is more dependent on those in the establishment he has been fighting until now, as well as American allies that have proved unreliable in the past, such as Turkey and some Gulf states. This scenario also presents virtually zero prospects for US-Russia cooperation in Syria.<br>3.

 The military strikes might not have been coordinated with Moscow, but there was some kind of an agreement via military or intelligence channels that the action would be taken for political reasons that would sit well with the White House and the Kremlin. Those supporting this third narrative point to the rather courteous nature of the bilateral communication before the attack.

As a result, the strikes destroyed only one equipment depot, a training building, six MiG-23 aircraft in repair hangars and a radar station, while the runway, taxiways and Syrian air force aircraft in parking areas remained intact.<br>One theory insists that since the poisonous gas attack was the first serious international crisis for the American president, he had to respond forcefully. Yet, unwilling to risk a full-scale war with Russia, he had to have an agreement with Moscow that Russia’s response wouldn’t go beyond the expected heated rhetoric and some symbolic moves that wouldn’t hurt American interests. The strikes would punish Assad and satisfy warmongers in the United States and the region — but the conflict could be mitigated eventually, as Lavrov and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson meet April 11-12.<br>However, the Kremlin said Tillerson will not be meeting with Putin, Reuters reported April 10.<br>Another theory is that there were no formal contacts between Russia and the United States, but the Russians knew long ago that the attack was coming.

It has been downhill ever since: war between Russia and Georgia in August 2008; Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014 and 2015; and now, Russian moves to undercut what little Western policy attempts there have been in Syria.<br>Much of the focus at the Munich Security Conference will likely be on the acute crisis that the ongoing Assad-Putin offensive has caused around Aleppo. But there is a strong need for a longer term approach to tackling the security challenge that a revisionist, nationalist and increasingly militaristic Russia poses in Europe. Three steps are essential to this end:<br>1. Step up support for Ukraine<br>According to the Minsk agreement for Eastern Ukraine, Ukraine must be allowed to regain full control over its entire Eastern border. It is important that Western pressure, including the use of sanctions, is kept up until this is the case. The issue of Crimea should be dealt with afterward.<br>Signs suggest that Russia is seeking to consolidate its military control over the Donbas region, and that the Kremlin wants to broker some sort of political deal with the West. Sanctions are taking their toll, but the Kremlin is prepared to stick it out, expecting reforms to fail in Kiev and calculating that the attention of Washington and Brussels — well, Berlin — will eventually turn elsewhere.<br>A half-baked deal that temporarily freezes the conflict today and leaves it open to flare up again tomorrow is in no one’s interest — least of all Russia’s. If the country wants a shot at the reforms it desperately needs, a true settlement in Donbas will be essential.<br>An international peacekeeping force, preferably with a U.N. mandate, could come in for a few years and ensure the region’s transfer back to stability within Ukraine. So far the Kremlin is strongly opposed, and places faith in its long-term destabilization efforts. But a firm Western line against half-measures could make the Kremlin change its position.<br>Western countries should also be ready to bolster Ukraine’s defensive capabilities in order to support the country’s political process and block military options for the Kremlin.<br>2. Choose deterrence over short-term reassurance in Poland and the Baltics<br>I fail to see any immediate risk of Russia taking aggressive action against any of these countries. They are stable democracies and solid members of both the EU and NATO. But we have a duty to look ahead a few years.<br>The future is increasingly uncertain, and we may well be headed toward a period of maximum danger in our relations with Russia. In 5 to 10 years, the Putin regime will face its unavoidable end, and will be considering its legacy. The country’s economic and social crisis will no doubt have deepened and its perception of its military might continued to soar. If Russia sees Europe fracturing, and the West waning, temptation to act will be high.<br>It is important that we build up a solid defense today as a deterrent against these adventurist tendencies down the line.<br>The NATO Warsaw summit in July should also take further measures in this direction. Recent studies by the RAND Corporation have pointed to the need to significantly beef up the defenses of the Baltic states and Poland, including the pre-positioning of equipment for heavy army units in these areas.<br>Washington recently announced it would quadruple its funding for the European Reassurance Initiative, among other measures. These are steps in the right direction, but they clearly aren’t enough.<br>3. Create a new timetable for ballistic missile defense in Europe<br>Russia should certainly respect the defense concerns of its vulnerable neighbors, but that does not mean that we should be blind to Russia’s own concerns.<br>Although NATO, for diplomatic reasons, never said so explicitly, it was always clear that the U.S. ballistic missile defense system in Europe was about the threat from Iran. Great efforts went into demonstrating that it had nothing to do with Russia.<br>In his April 2009 speech in Prague,

<br>Iran continues to develop ballistic missiles, but with ranges geared to its more immediate region, and without nuclear warheads: The threat to Europe has been reduced. Existing and soon-to-be-completed naval systems, as well as the fixed site in Romania, can, according to studies, counter an Iranian threat far greater than exists today.<br>Accordingly, it makes sense to postpone the third phase of the missile defense system planned for 2018 in Poland. It serves no military need, and might well be used by Russia to leave the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty limiting medium-range missiles in Europe, increasing the risk of a dangerous new nuclear arms race in Europe.<br>The strategic landscape policymakers will discuss in Munich this year is very different from what it was a year ago — never mind five years ago.<br>The immediate issues that will preoccupy ministerial meetings have to be seen in a greater strategic perspective. The current meltdown in the Middle East is beginning to look like a version of Europe’s Thirty Years’ War, and will require a long-term approach — as does a militarized and revisionist Russia, which is likely to be around for years. Constitutionally, President Putin could be in office together with the U.S. president coming after the one that will be elected in November of this year.<br>We need to start making decisions on how to face long-term challenges with forward-thinking policies. Munich is the place to start.<br>Carl Bildt is a former prime minister and foreign minister of Sweden.

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Thirty years after the failed August 1991 coup in the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the country four months later, it is hard to avoid asking: What led to the demise of that superpower and are the same factors relevant for its successor, today’s Russia? The final years of the USSR have been the subject of many studies, including post-Soviet reformer Yegor Gaidar’s “Collapse of an Empire: Lessons for Modern Russia.” Five years ago, Russia Matters’ Simon Saradzhyan carried out a thoughtful analysis of the factors identified by Gaidar and found that some do apply to Russia still. Rather than retrace their steps, this article will consider what we have learned since then. The main takeaway is very simple.<br>Despite certain important differences in the overall circumstances, the key dynamic for today’s Russia is similar to that faced by the late-Soviet-era leadership: Rapid economic growth requires reforms; reforms frighten entrenched elites; lack of economic growth will eventually force the regime to change—though whether this means more democratization or more repressiveness remains to be seen.<br>In recent years, we have seen the crystallization—or ossification—of Putin’s political and economic model. There are certainly some similarities between this model and the Soviet one, but there are also major differences. Like its Soviet predecessor, the Russian government believes in controlling

</mark>
 of the economy rather than relying on private entrepreneurship; since 2014, its geopolitical stance has also resulted in major isolation from the global economy. As in the 1970s-1980s, this has given rise to economic stagnation.<br>On the other hand, Russia’s macroeconomic policymaking is much more competent that the USSR’s. In the last years of the Soviet Union, the government did not understand the unsustainability of fixed prices (which resulted in unprecedented shortages and multi-hour lines); it ran enormous budget deficits and eventually went bankrupt. Today, Russia has very low debt, maintains a large sovereign wealth fund and runs a conservative fiscal policy. The Central Bank of Russia has switched to a monetary policy based on inflation targeting and a flexible exchange rate, which allows it to keep inflation under control. Therefore, even though the Russian economy is certainly stagnating, it is unlikely to go through a macroeconomic crisis in any foreseeable future.<br>Putin’s political model is also different from the Soviet one. The Soviet regime was an ideological party-based dictatorship; modern Russia is a personalistic and kleptocratic autocracy. Like many nondemocratic regimes around the world today, Russia is 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    an “informational autocracy”

</mark>
: It pretends to be democratic, uses targeted rather than mass repressions, denies complicity in killing its political opponents in Russia and abroad and allows independent media and opposition parties. In the last couple of years, Russia has certainly become much more repressive; yet, even now, the level of repression (proxied, e.g., by the number of political prisoners) is not comparable to that of the pre-Gorbachev Soviet Union. This is also an important advantage relative to the Soviet model: As Daniel Treisman and I argue in our research on informational autocracies, such shapeshifting regimes are better suited for the modern age of cross-border information flows, global media and an educated workforce.<br>While Putin’s political system is more flexible than the Soviet one, they share an important disadvantage: They both reject necessary reforms. In his recent book “The Struggle to Save the Soviet Economy,” the Fletcher School’s Chris Miller argues that Mikhail Gorbachev’s attempts to reform the Soviet economy were doomed as he could not overcome powerful interest groups. Miller shows that Gorbachev and his advisors understood the need for reforms and examined various reform models, including those of post-Mao China. However, as defense, energy and agricultural lobbies held substantial economic and political power, all Gorbachev’s economic reform efforts stalled or failed. Putin’s government also sees that the current political and economic model cannot deliver faster income growth. But the Russian government understands that reforms would undermine the political control of the ruling elite: In order to accelerate economic growth, Russia needs rule of law, better protection of property rights, re-integration into the global economy and effective ways to fight both corruption and the state’s domination of the economy. Such reforms would result in the emergence of a large independent middle class of entrepreneurs and professionals who would demand political representation.<br>In keeping with the famous adage that 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    “you can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time,”
    <span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">Content</span>
</mark>
 mine and Treisman’s theory of informational autocracy implies that eventually a majority of voters will figure out that the leadership is failing to deliver prosperity, which will result in declining popularity and ultimately changes to the regime. This is certainly a likely outcome for Russia in the long run: Without income growth Russia will either democratize or go back to being a traditional fear-based dictatorship (as we saw in Venezuela after the decline of oil prices and the death of the charismatic Hugo Chávez).<br>There is of course another difference between Russia and the Soviet Union: In the last 30 years, information technology has made enormous progress. Some economists have speculated that modern artificial intelligence (AI) can help build a functioning version of the central planning system that failed so badly in the 1980s. So far neither Russia nor China—which possesses much more advanced AI technology—has tried to use AI to create a digital Gosplan. Probably both Russian and Chinese elites remember that fixing prices, even with the most powerful computers, is much riskier than letting markets balance supply and demand. Shortages are not only bad for economic efficiency; they also create lines, which is a perfect way to mobilize a large number of unhappy citizens.<br>However, the new technology may be a game changer for a different reason: There is a natural symbiosis between dictatorial governments and AI firms. Dictators do not respect privacy and therefore can provide unprecedented arrays of data to AI firms, which in turn can use these to earn additional profits. Meanwhile, a world-class AI sector helps dictators create a perfect surveillance state.<br>Evolving into such a digital dictatorship is a plausible trajectory for the Chinese regime but much less likely for Russia where rampant corruption, a relatively small domestic economy and isolation from the global economy prevent AI firms from scaling up—and AI is an industry where scale is the most important driver of productivity. Whatever happens with AI in China, it is unlikely to accelerate economic growth in Russia. Which brings us back to square one: There will be no fast economic growth without reforms; there will be no reforms; without economic growth, the regime will eventually have to change.<br>Will this change result in Russia’s falling apart like the Soviet Union did 30 years ago? The likely answer is no. Whether Russia will become freer or more repressive, it will still be much more homogenous than the Soviet Union. The demographic differences are huge: In the Soviet Union ethnic Russians accounted for about half the population; in modern Russia their share exceeds 80 percent. The USSR included 14 non-Russian republics with strong national identities and national elites; these comprised one-third of its territory and half the population. Out of modern Russia’s 85 constituent territories, 27 are so-called ethnic republics, autonomous districts and autonomous oblasts, but they are small and very poor or landlocked or both. It may well be the case that one or a handful of these regions will try to secede, but it is highly unlikely that Russia will disintegrate.<br>Sergei Guriev is a professor of economics at Sciences Po in Paris.<br>Photo by David Broad shared under a Creative Commons license. The opinions expressed herein are solely those of the author.</div>

 between Trump and Putin shatters EU unity and allows Russia to bring Ukraine into its sphere of influence.<br>To prevent any of these doomsday scenarios from unfolding, the EU must stay the course by maintaining a strong and united Russia policy. It can do this by automating the sanctions renewal process and stepping in where the US is stepping out in Ukraine.<br>Introduction<br>In the three years since the invasion of Ukraine, something rather remarkable has happened: Europe has maintained unity on its policy towards Russia. The question of what to do about Russia has a long history of dividing the European Union – sometimes bitterly so. But today there is a broad consensus on the challenge that Russia poses, along with an acceptance – though grudging in certain quarters – of the measures that Europe should take to contain it. This consensus has survived the refugee crisis, the Brexit vote, the election of Donald Trump, and a host of other elections and political upsets, as well as the differing views on sanctions among Europeans, and Russia’s best efforts to split Europe. It has also defied the pundits’ predictions that European unity would collapse. In the end, Europe’s unity has proven stronger and more resilient than many believed it could be.<br>Despite this unity, what are the forces pulling the EU apart on Russia and Ukraine? And what would the consequences be if Europe’s policy towards Russia and Ukraine unravelled? The purpose of this essay is to consider these questions. But it does so not by describing the past or the present but rather by considering possible futures. These scenarios show different ways in which European policy towards Russia and Ukraine could come crashing down. Their purpose is to highlight the political dynamics and forces that could undermine the current policy as well as to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of Europe’s stance. They also show the consequences of Europe not staying the course.<br>The four scenarios of collapse are:<br>

Only a few months earlier, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s chances of clinching yet another term seemed like a forgone conclusion. The prospect of Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen, and the Five Star Movement governing the planet had made many Germans uneasy and led them to opt for stability. But by election day, the mood had changed. Tired of watching the same chancellor on television for over a decade, vast numbers of Germans complained about

, longed for something new, and decided to vote for fringe parties, or not vote at all. A terrorist attack carried out a week before the elections by a refugee under surveillance by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution caused a crisis of confidence in the government – and again boosted anti-establishment sentiment.<br>As the results of the elections trickled in during the evening of 24 September − incidentally the warmest day in Germany in two centuries − television viewers slowly came to the realisation that support for Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) had collapsed. The parties lost to the Social Democratic Party (SPD) by a double-digit margin. That same evening, Merkel told a stunned nation that she was stepping down after 12 years as chancellor. The next day, SPD leader Martin Schulz declared that there had been an agreement to form a coalition government comprised of the Social Democrats, Die Linke, and the Greens.<br>The shift in Germany’s policy towards Russia was not immediate, but it took only a week. Key staff in the Chancellery were replaced by newcomers who lacked understanding of the tactical obstacles faced in the Normandy Format negotiations or the Trilateral Contact Group in Minsk. After a hasty policy review, the new Chancellery staff adopted a ‘Neuanfang mit Russland’ policy –

    a ‘new beginning with Russia’

 policy. They concluded that Russia had been treated unfairly and that Kyiv was primarily to blame for non-implementation of the Minsk agreements. Anonymous sources in the Chancellery vehemently denied that the review had anything to do with the detrimental effects of the sanctions on the German economy. The new foreign minister and Die Linke party leader, Sahra Wagenknecht, publicly came out in favour of this ‘new beginning’.<br>Berlin’s first step consisted of pressurising Kyiv into accepting Russia’s demands for local elections in the People’s Republics of Donetsk (DNR) and Lugansk (LNR) and for the adoption, by Kyiv, of a law conferring special status on the territories without any sustained ceasefire or troop withdrawals. This new approach to Minsk was opposed by the Baltic states, the Scandinavians, the United Kingdom, and several eastern European states. But they were unable to mount a meaningful coalition to counter Berlin’s might, in particular, because the Trump administration had come out – for once – in support of Berlin. The still fresh-faced French president, Emmanuel Macron, was instinctively firm on Russia, especially after its meddling in his country’s presidential election. But he shied away from picking a fight with Berlin over Russia and Ukraine since his priority was to build a working relationship with Berlin to push through his economic agenda.<br>Member states that had long been interested in lifting sanctions – Italy, Hungary, and Austria – were delighted with the new winds blowing down from Berlin and lined up to support the new approach. They were quick to portray Ukraine as a lost cause and a failed state. While they were tactful enough to avoid calling openly for the immediate lifting of sanctions, they pushed the line that Europe needed to be tougher on Ukraine and impose more conditions to ensure that Kyiv implemented its obligations under Minsk.<br>The European Council meeting in December 2017 was something of a turning point. In a late-night session, Chancellor Martin Schulz cornered a clutch of north European leaders huddling in a corridor and strong-armed them into supporting his new beginning with Russia and, in particular, his plan to revise the sanctions policy against Russia. The new policy held that sanctions on Russia would only be renewed if Kyiv adopted the Donbas special status law and allowed Russia to hold local elections in the DNR and LNR.<br>The EU’s new approach was met with heavy resistance in Kyiv and caused an outcry within Ukrainian civil society. But the Ukrainian government had little choice but to accept this new reality. Even at the Eastern Partnership Summit in November, Schulz had already linked the continuation of visa liberalisation and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area Agreement (DCFTA) with implementation of Minsk. The Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, feared that confronting Europe might put three years’ worth of reform in jeopardy and was mindful that Ukraine could barely survive without European support.<br>Poroshenko agreed to the EU’s demands in order to avoid criticism from his European colleagues, yet he secretly hoped that the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) would, in the end, not recognise the elections as legitimate. But ODIHR – already under heavy pressure from various autocrats in central Asia and

 in Europe – caved in to Wagenknecht’s demand that the organisation accept the ‘new reality’ and devised a statement on the elections that amounted to rubber-stamping them as free and fair.<br>The local elections in the Donbas were nothing less than a farce. As voters headed to the polls, machine gun fire could be heard in the distance. Ukrainian political parties were barred from running and Ukrainian media were banned from visiting the Donbas to cover the elections. Instead, local ‘separatist’ media ran the show, reporting a misleading blend of fact and fiction. Special detachments of officers sent by the Russian Armed Forces’ Main Intelligence Directorate sought to intimidate and even eliminate candidates who did not support the Russian occupation.<br>A war-like situation of daily shelling and fire-fights on the separatist ‘borders’, and the presence of landmines, made campaigning all but impossible and deterred internally displaced persons living on the Kyiv-controlled side from making the treacherous journey to polling stations. The few ODIHR election observers symbolically deployed to the DNR and LNR were escorted by separatist militias and only taken to designated polling stations. The outcome was a given and the elections were merely a spectacle to legitimise the separatists.<br>Understanding that the separatist regimes were nowhere to stay, nearly half the population of DNR and LNR packed up their belongings and crossed into the Kyiv-controlled parts of the Donbas. Those who remained were mostly pensioners who were too old to leave, or war veterans who would be arrested if they ever crossed the line.<br>Days after the elections, the new authorities demanded additional funds from Kyiv to finance the people’s republics. In particular, they demanded social payments, arguing that the Minsk agreements required this. Berlin and other European capitals seemed to confirm this interpretation of Minsk, enraging the Ukrainians. Budgetary sessions of the Ukrainian Rada ended in fist-fights because lawmakers did not want to be associated with amendments to funnel more money into the Russian proxy states.<br>The elections were proclaimed a great success in Moscow. Seeing that it had come closer to its goal of bringing Ukraine into its orbit, the Kremlin ordered the DNR and LNR forces to increase their military pressure on Ukraine. Russian intelligence personnel based in the DNR and LNR used their newly won immunity to liaise with pro-Russian activists across Ukraine. In Odessa, Kharkiv, Dnipro and other cities, members of subversive hooligan clubs (titushki) began exerting pressure on local reformists, investigative journalists, and politicians. Corrupt local security services did little to stop their expansion and collusion with organised crime.[1] These helped to create pro-Russian front organisations in preparation for a wider insurgency and to portray Ukraine as a failing state in Europe. In an increasingly destabilised Ukraine, the prospects for economic growth diminished, and investors began to leave the country.<br>But the tipping point came when the separatists tried to claim their seats in the Rada.

 the Donbas, as ultimately foreseen in the Minsk agreements, separatist politicians took part in the 2019 elections. The Donbas candidates were mostly Russian-backed separatists who had fought in the war there. Most of the candidates were easily elected, which meant the end of normal political life in Kyiv. Ukrainian civil society organised massive demonstrations against the members of parliament who were seen as Russian Trojan horses. It did not take long before the demonstrations turned violent.<br>The outbreak of violence was the signal for the titushki clubs across Ukraine to stage major anti-government protests. These orchestrated protests managed to attract Ukrainians who felt deep frustration with the government in Kyiv and anger at the economic downturn, the corruption, and the war in the east. In several cities, protests and counter-protests ended in rioting and clashes with the police. The human toll was significantly higher than the 2014 revolution. The Kremlin watched closely to see whether the ongoing revolts presented an opportunity for them to stage a takeover in Kyiv.<br>Separatist forces, many of which were composed of regular Russian soldiers, were transformed into

 them. They continued to receive material support from Russia but could now do so legally as part of the cross-border cooperation framework, which Moscow claimed was all in line with Minsk. This was facilitated by Russia’s control of the border, which it had refused to relinquish to Ukraine, claiming that it would only do so once Ukraine had fully lived up to its Minsk-related obligations.<br>As the anti-government protests grew, these units were sent across the line of contact to provide protection for the demonstrators. Separatist putsches were launched in Odessa and Dnipro, but ultimately failed. One of the, however, did succeed, in Kharkiv. Under such circumstances, policymaking in Kyiv ground to a complete halt. Poroshenko declared a nationwide state of emergency and began ruling by decree. A new government was formed with prime minister Arsen Avakov at the helm. Having already built up his own ‘deep state’ during his stint as minister of interior, he became Ukraine’s new patriotic strongman. He relied on the Ukrainian Intelligence Service to rule the country, using the intel it gathered for political purposes.<br>The international outcry over Russia’s actions began all over again, but Europe was divided on how to react this time.

 policy, refused to go along with any further measures against Russia. Instead, the best that the European Council could come up with was to issue carefully worded conclusions calling on all sides to show restraint and seek a peaceful solution. The US reaction was equally balanced and equivocal. The willingness to play along with the Minsk plan and steer Ukraine into a quagmire had not only delegitimised Poroshenko, it had destroyed the Ukrainian people’s trust in the entire post-Maidan political class and the EU. Those who could, from the young innovative generation, left Ukraine for Europe.<br>The decision to force the Minsk agreements upon Kyiv made central and eastern European countries in the EU weary of western European leadership. The distrust within Europe and subsequent conflicts brought EU policymaking to a standstill, impeding reform of the EU and the eurozone. The formation of issue-specific coalitions or permanent structured cooperation, as outlined in the treaties, was blocked by northern and eastern European member states due to their distrust of the old members. The credibility of EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy was dealt a serious blow, especially its ability to deliver stability and reform in the eastern neighbourhood. The inability of Brussels to find any consolidated policy vis-à-vis Russia led some member states to consider forging bilateral deals to ensure their own security needs were met. In the end, the political chaos in Kyiv spilled over into Brussels.<br>Scenario two: Normalising the status quo in Ukraine<br>The Eastern Partnership Summit was held in November 2017 with little fanfare but many questions about what would come next for the region. For Ukraine, the two big deliverables − the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area agreement (DCFTA) and visa liberalisation – had been delivered, but there were no new flagship projects to promote the Europeanisation of Ukraine or to incentivise further reforms. Europe, preoccupied with domestic crises and political squabbles caused by the Brexit negotiations, had, by late 2017, lost interest in Ukraine. While some member states still considered Ukraine important, they could not muster the political will in Europe to push for further deepening of relations. Germany and a few other member states had even tried to roll back European Union commitments acknowledging Ukraine’s European aspirations. 2018 was a year of muddling through.<br>In Ukraine, the lack of attention from Europe, and the lack of new deliverables, led first to stagnation and then backsliding on reforms. Petro Poroshenko reached out to oligarchs from the era of Viktor Yanukovych to redistribute their economic gains in exchange for political loyalty. The 2019 elections pitted Poroshenko against the oligarch Victor Pinchuk – an easy win for the latter. Brussels was not unhappy about the outcome, but this ‘victory’ had come at the cost of delegitimising and isolating alternative pro-European candidates, such as Serhiy Leshchenko. Selective investigations, politically motivated trials, and biased television coverage, were again part of Ukraine’s domestic politics. Soon ‘new Ukraine’ looked much like ‘old Ukraine’, and the traditional supporters of Kyiv in Brussels were less and less tempted to raise their voices on the country’s behalf.<br>By 2019, the two people’s republics in the Donbas had become de facto military dictatorships run from the Kremlin. The local economies – beyond organised crime – had effectively collapsed. Once most of the oligarch Rinat Akhmetov’s factories had been nationalised and re-located to Russia, separatist armed forces became the main employer. After pressure from Europe to make

 and the realisation in Kyiv that the EU had lost interest in Ukraine, the Rada passed a short constitutional amendment to give increased autonomy to the Donbas on the condition that it would only enter into force when Russia withdrew its forces and handed back control of the border. Moscow rejected this condition and maintained its control of the entities through its military and intelligence presence.<br>The security situation along the line of contact remained unchanged, with daily exchanges of artillery and gunfire. Russia still enjoyed a wide range of military options in the region – forcing Kyiv to divert a sizeable part of its budget and government attention to keeping up its military presence in the East. The continuous tension in the Donbas region deterred investors and businesses, creating economic imbalances within the country and increasing latent tensions within the rest of Ukraine.<br>Angela Merkel resigned as chancellor in the summer of 2020. Her successor, the former German minister of the interior, Thomas de Maizière, was not sympathetic to Russia but had little experience of dealing with Putin. With a special status law in place for the DNR and LNR – albeit an unimplementable one due to the Russian military presence – many observers in Europe concluded that the Minsk agreements would only ever be partially implemented. Full implementation, they argued, was unrealistic and they should accept what they could achieve. In the autumn of 2020, after another banking crisis in Italy, southern Europe was hit by a recession. Disputes over fiscal stability and labour market reforms erupted again between the northern member states and the ‘olive belt’. For Emmanuel Macron, this recession was especially bitter, as the effects of his economic reforms were about to be felt.

 towards implementing them, sanctions should be partially lifted. This, it was argued, would encourage the Kremlin to pursue further implementation. Sanctions were lifted on arms and dual-use goods, and financial restrictions on state-owned enterprises were also lifted. The lifting of these sanctions – incidentally the ones that mattered most to Russia – signalled to Moscow that Europe had given up on the eastern neighbourhood, and prioritised relations with Russia once again. To the dismay of Italian and French businesses, Russia did not fully reciprocate, only lifting its counter-sanctions towards individuals. Its restrictive measures on trade had become a permanent – and for some a lucrative – feature of Russia’s economy.<br>The Kremlin perceived the gradual retreat of Europe as de facto acquiescence to its interests and ambitions in the eastern neighbourhood. Europe’s actions lent credence to Moscow’s belief that, as long as it stuck to its position, Europeans would always give in to pressure – even if it took time. Europe held on in Ukraine for longer than it did in Georgia, but in the end it gave up there as well.<br>Soon after the partial lifting of sanctions, Moscow increased its active measures in Ukraine. Orders were sent out to connect organised crime networks, the anti-government opposition, and titushki hooligan clubs, with the Russian intelligence services operating from the Donbas. The people’s republics became sanctuaries for drug smuggling and human trafficking networks, money laundering, forgery, and cyber-crime. The spread of these activities not only destabilised Ukraine, but also gave birth to permanent tension between Brussels and Kyiv, with the former demanding that the latter block the spread of organised crime from Donbas. Corruption among some political actors, oligarchs, and domestic security services, was the second stage of destabilisation. It reinforced the dysfunctional state of Ukraine’s government, increased domestic cleavages, and furthered delays to the implementation of the DCFTA.<br>The stalemate in reforms hindered the diversification of trade relations and Ukraine remained dependent on the Russian market, which provided an opening for Moscow to exert influence on key oligarchs. European businesses lost interest in the Ukrainian market due to high levels of corruption and an inefficient judiciary. Ukraine suffered from extensive brain-drain, under-investment, unemployment, and economic stagnation.<br>While Russia did not have the resources to replace the investment of departing European businesses, the status quo meant that Kyiv was unable to move towards the West. This kind of controlled and ambiguous instability served the Kremlin well because it neither had to directly manage Ukraine, nor to expose itself to Western criticism for subduing the country. Still, it could delegitimise the EU as a stabilising force in the neighbourhood and beyond, and dissuade Europeans from trying to further engage in other countries on Russia’s periphery.<br>The Kremlin concluded that controlled instability was an ideal tool for controlling the neighbourhood and, by extension, containing Europe and the West. The chaos it created prevented Euro-Atlantic institutions from enlarging further and made European stabilisation of the immediate neighbourhood a costly affair that prevented the West from applying its tools elsewhere. Accepting the Donbas as a frozen conflict was the optimal result for Russia in the short term.<br>Scenario three: Collapse of sanctions and the end of support for Ukraine<br>While the daily revelations concerning the Trump team’s ties to Russia were something of a distraction for the US president during 2017, his government still managed to win its battle with Congress over cuts to foreign assistance budgets.[2] This was just one strand of the administration’s general goal of retreating from the business of

 on support efforts in Ukraine. Trump’s antics during his first six months in office had made him politically toxic in Europe and actually contributed to a strengthening of European unity. European politicians quickly realised that taking on Trump and pushing policies that ran counter to whatever Trump said or did had immediate and broad appeal among voters. Even in Italy, calls for supporting Ukraine could be heard. At one point, anti-Trumpism became a real unifying force in European politics.<br>But this unity dividend proved to be short-lived. With the United States having lost interest in Ukraine, the balance of power within the EU shifted to the southern members who were largely dubious about EU engagement in Ukraine. Italy, Austria, Greece, and Hungary seized the opportunity presented by Washington’s slashing of aid to push for the EU to do the same. There was some resistance from Germany, which, together with Sweden and a few eastern European states, increased humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. The United Kingdom increased its bilateral support for Ukraine too, but only discreetly, so as not to appear too out of sync with the United States. But Poland and several others were reluctant about following Berlin since they did not want to take sides in the growing transatlantic rift. Other states – particularly France, which was still focusing on domestic reforms – remained ominously silent.<br>When European and Ukrainian leaders met in Kyiv at the EU-Ukraine summit in July 2017, there was not enough political will or consensus among Europeans for any sort of

. Transatlantic coordination had been essential for upholding the strategic Western response towards Russian action in Ukraine. It was also the glue that kept Europeans together and firm in their backing for Ukraine. A lack of commitment from Trump towards NATO’s Article 5 – the bloc’s mutual defence clause – had also made many Europeans nervous about being over-exposed in Ukraine and too hawkish on Russia. The family photo from the summit showed a handful of sulky European leaders struggling to put on a brave face; leading European newspapers spilled much ink speculating about the meaning of limp handshakes at the summit.<br>Because the EU was split on how to progress in Ukraine, European leaders were only able to agree on a strategic review of the current support effort. In early 2018, assistance programmes for Ukraine were put on hold until the review was concluded and a new policy approach agreed. Increases in bilateral assistance from Germany, Poland, the UK, the Scandinavian countries, and the Baltic countries were too small to fill the gap created by this freeze. Support for Ukraine was also attacked in the domestic debate in several European states as populist parties turned the issue into a cause célèbre. In mid-2018, Federica Mogherini, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, tried to reconcile the different positions of member states, but this effort was ultimately in vain. When European heads of government eventually discussed the issue, they failed to agree on a common policy – hence the freeze in assistance became permanent.<br>The end of assistance to Ukraine reignited an intra-European discussion on the Minsk process and the Normandy Format. Leaders of Italy, Greece, and Austria, became louder in demanding that local elections in the Donbas should be held regardless of the security situation if Kyiv wanted to continue receiving European support. Merkel and a few other leaders pushed back on this, favouring 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    the ‘security first’ approach. But as Washington became vocal in supporting Italy – largely in order to gain leverage over Germany on trade – the European consensus fell apart again. The demand for elections without preconditions on security infuriated Kyiv and Ukrainian society. Minsk was considered by a majority of Ukrainians to be a betrayal of the Ukrainian soldiers fighting on the frontline since it legitimised the presence of Russia’s proxy separatists. But now, having to hold elections without a ceasefire was seen as a double betrayal. With domestic pressure increasing on Poroshenko to stand up to Europe and protect Ukraine’s interests, the room for manoeuvre on both sides shrank.

The real shock, however, came just days after the November 2018 mid-term elections in the United States when the Republican party won a landslide victory. Minutes before midnight on 15 November, an emboldened and unimpeachable President Trump signed an executive order cancelling all sanctions on Russia with immediate effect. Despite efforts by both houses to tie the administration down on Russia, binding legislation on sanctions was vetoed by the president. After the signing ceremony,

.<br>European leaders, having learned of the news via Twitter, began calling each other to figure out a common position. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, gained some support from colleagues in northern Europe that this was yet another example of why Europe needed to stand firm and united given that the US could no longer be trusted. It was an opportunity to show that the EU’s sanctions policy was independent of that of the US. But southern Europe pushed back, arguing that it was pointless for the EU to continue its sanctions regime without US sanctions in place. Having had good trading links with Russia in the past, and struggling with economic crises, they asked: why should Europe pay the price of sanctions while US companies could reap all the benefits of doing business in Russia? In the end, the divide within the EU grew too wide and no common position could be agreed upon. The sanctions lapsed.<br>At the 20th EU-Ukraine summit in December 2018 the split in vision and policies was clear for all to see. The breakdown of the sanctions policy and the end of assistance to Ukraine had sapped the EU’s credibility and any leverage it had in Ukraine. The summit ended early as the entrenched positions on both sides could not be reconciled. Leading European newspapers speculated about the meaning of missing handshakes.<br>While leaving the summit, some heads of government from northern Europe pledged to continue – and indeed increase – their sanctions on Russia. But pundits were quick to point out that this only highlighted the divisions in Europe and the collapse of consensus. The leaders of Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the UK also promised Poroshenko that Ukraine would receive support in the form of military trainers and advisers, along with lethal weapons.<br>But, despite these scattered efforts to compensate for the breakdown of policy, the end of EU sanctions against Russia dealt a devastating blow to Ukraine. The perception in Ukraine was that first the US and now the EU had given up on the country and left it to deal with Russia alone. An isolated but pugilistic Poroshenko declared the Normandy Format and Minsk process dead.<br>As the presidential election in Ukraine approached and the main challenger, Yulia Tymoshenko, gained in the polls, Poroshenko’s language turned increasingly anti-EU and nationalistic. This message found deep resonance among the Ukrainians, many of whom felt betrayed by the EU after the sacrifices made in Maidan square and in the Donbas. Historians would later use biblical terms to describe the significance of ending the sanctions to Ukraine’s European aspirations.<br>Large parts of the Ukrainian political elite quickly resorted to

 and abandoned the harsh transparency and anti-corruption rules put in place thanks to international pressure. The 2019 parliamentary election resulted in an even more fragmented Rada, with populist parties gaining major shares of the vote. In the years that followed, Ukraine entered a period of domestic political turbulence, changing governments more than twice a year.<br>Meanwhile, in Moscow, the narrative that its policy on Ukraine had been a great success was accepted as gospel truth. Kremlin insiders believed that they had singlehandedly managed to push the West out of the neighbourhood while at the same time rupturing the transatlantic alliance and dividing the EU. As Ukraine dived deeper into crisis, Moscow stepped up its activity in the Donbas and used political unrest to instigate further uprisings around the country. The Kremlin employed its full range of destabilising and subversive measures: propaganda and disinformation, corruption, cyber-attacks, false-flag attacks by ‘Ukrainian nationalists’, sponsorship of illegal armed groups, and support for organised crime.<br>The aim of these actions was not only to destabilise Ukraine but to discredit it as

    a ‘failed state’ and deter Brussels from ever restarting support programmes in Ukraine. Pro-Russian parties in Europe, notably France’s Front National and Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), embraced this narrative and even demanded sanctions on Ukraine, citing “democratic backsliding”

 due to the uncertain circumstances. On top of its subversive activities, Moscow tried to increase Kyiv’s economic isolation by initiating a naval blockade on the remaining Ukrainian Black Sea ports to curtail attempts by Kyiv to tap export markets beyond the EU. While Moscow ultimately aimed to bring Ukraine into its sphere of influence, it could accept – as second best – a weak and dysfunctional Ukraine that had no prospects of moving further towards the West.<br>In Ukraine, a paralysed Rada could neither deliver on reforms nor on stable support for the government. Time and again the Ukrainian army proved to be the only stable, functioning institution in the country, setting the scene for it to become a ‘state within the state’. After Ukraine lost international support, some civil society actors turned towards the army with their demands for reform. Despite the progress made on reforms, the Ukraine that eventually emerged resembled a Kemalist republic, where the armed forces are the true guardian of the political order, rather than a European-style democracy.<br>Beyond Ukraine, Moscow was still set on renegotiating the post-cold war security order on Russian terms and extending its influence into other regions, especially since the end of sanctions had provided a boost to the economy. But the costs for Russia of instigating new conflicts in its immediate neighbourhood were perceived to be too high in Moscow. Russia was therefore tempted to try other fronts. It found fertile ground in the western Balkans, where dissatisfaction with the EU, local corruption, political mismanagement, and the refugee crisis had again stirred up nationalist tension and sparked calls for revising the territorial status quo once more.[3] Russia’s close contact with Serb nationalists and ultra-conservative Orthodox forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Kosovo, meant that it had natural allies on the ground. Domestically, the unravelling of the political order in the Balkans was seen in Moscow as vengeance for the ‘decade of humiliation’ it faced in the 1990s. Having used Ukraine as a ‘test case’, Russia employed its methods of subversion to generate more

 under the umbrella of the war against terror. The eastern neighbourhood fell squarely within the Russian sphere. Happy to finally strike a deal with Russia, and with the enthusiastic cheering of his aide, Steve Bannon, Trump immediately signed the treaty. Upon touching down back in Washington, DC, he signed a series of executive orders to withdraw all US military personnel from the region, end sanctions on Russia, and cancel all US-funded programmes relating to Ukraine and Georgia.<br>​<br>For the Kremlin, the Trump-Putin Pact was a key strategic victory. Replacing the current European security order with one based on delineated spheres of influence was far more important to Moscow than actual territorial acquisitions in the immediate neighbourhood.[4] For years, Moscow had tried to package this goal with different wrapping paper: from the new treaty on European Security, to formalised EU-Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) relations, to making the Organization for Security Co-operation in Europe the centre-piece of European security. But no one in the West had ever taken the bait – until now.<br>When word of the treaty leaked, the reaction from the Washington establishment was as loud as it was predictable and ineffectual. Efforts by Senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman to set up a bipartisan caucus to veto the deal failed as most Republicans feared they would be punished by Trump’s support base in the 2018 midterm elections if they struck out against him. Some left-wing Democrats supported Trump on Russia in return for a more protectionist foreign trade policy and restrictions on political lobbying in Washington.<br>In Europe, the political mainstream was in shock. Trump’s deliberate failure to mention NATO’s mutual defence clause at the NATO summit in May had already rattled Europeans and their assumptions about the European security order.[5] Now, Trump’s willingness to cut a deal over the heads of Europeans caused reverberations around the continent. The newly re-elected German chancellor, Angela Merkel and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, held a joint press conference telling the world that the West, as we had known it, was no more and that Europe had to fend for itself. Opinion leaders wrote op-eds declaring the end of the post-war order, and think-tankers wrote think-pieces either arguing that we now needed to rethink a new model for European security or claiming that a new Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact had been signed.<br>The immediate effect was one of more unity in Europe. The argument that the US could not be trusted and that Europe was now on its own resonated throughout a shell-shocked Europe. The foreign ministers of Germany and France put forward a joint non-paper setting out, as

. This concept was quickly endorsed by other EU foreign ministers – even by the sceptics who did not want EU defence integration to compete with NATO or wanted to protect their defence industries. There were also pledges to increase support for Ukraine to offset the consequences of it being thrown under the bus by Washington. The need to stick together in the face of US abandonment of the neighbourhood was seen as paramount – at least for a couple of months.<br>By the end of 2017, unity was starting to fray. The Trump-Putin Pact had divided Europe into spheres of influence but had also undercut the basic assumptions of NATO as an alliance. Several allies calculated that, since collective defence was no longer reliable, they had to gain bilateral security assurances. Poland and the Baltic states entered into secret negotiations with the US to secure bilateral defence guarantees. Hungary and Austria also started secret negotiations, but with Moscow on non-aggression pacts. Other EU member states followed what would later become known as the ‘DC track’ or the ‘Moscow track’. Merkel and Macron recognised the historic challenge that Europe was facing and did what they could to hold Europeans together. But, despite the outrage over the Trump-Putin Pact, no European leader was willing to leave his or her country without reliable security guarantees or, indeed, risk the security of his or her own country for that of Ukraine or Georgia.<br>In Kyiv, Poroshenko tried in vain to mobilise his few remaining international supporters, while at the same time declaring a state of emergency and ordering partial mobilisation of troops. The Kremlin acted as fast as it could to implement the Trump-Putin Pact and, in particular, to pre-empt the possibility of the Trump administration reneging on its commitments. Moscow had learned how to deal with Trump’s unpredictability and sought to actively manage it. Senior Kremlin adviser Vladislav Surkov was dispatched to Kyiv with a sealed letter from Putin to Poroshenko. The basic demands were as follows:<br>To formally renege on the Association Agreement with the EU and renounce Ukraine’s aspiration to become a member of NATO and the EU;<br>To join the EEU and the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO);<br>To agree to security and intelligence service cooperation with Russia, as well as the deployment of Russian troops in Ukraine;<br>To formally recognise Crimea as Russian territory and accept an amnesty for the personnel engaged in the Donbas conflict.<br>Putin believed that these goals were within reach, as the Kremlin considered Ukraine’s western orientation to be a problem at the level of elites, rather than the people. Once the current ruling elites were replaced by other elites, Ukrainians would go along with Moscow’s demands, remembering their fraternal ties with Russia. But this was yet another grave miscalculation by Moscow in Ukraine. As the Maidan revolution had shown, the situation was rather the opposite. Revolutionary feelings were primarily directed against the ruling class in Ukraine who were leaning towards Russia, and only tilted against Moscow when its support for the corrupt old elites became all too obvious. And while large parts of the Ukrainian population had grown weary of their president and government over the last few years, the Kremlin misread the anti-government sentiment as pro-Russian support.<br>In the meeting with Surkov, Poroshenko read the letter and immediately rejected the demands, stating that Ukraine was never part of any negotiations on a ‘grand bargain’ and that no foreign power had the right to decide Ukraine’s future. Despite threats of

    ‘grave consequences’

, Surkov left the presidential administration empty-handed and flew back to Moscow to brief Putin. After a short meeting, Putin ordered staff to initiate Operation Ukrainian Fall, a plan to depose Poroshenko in what would appear to be a palace coup and install the pro-Russian politician Viktor Medvedchuk as president.<br>Putin also ordered the mobilisation of the western and southern military districts. This build-up gained little international attention as the world’s media was more focused on the unfolding coup attempt in Kyiv. The increased military infrastructure on the border to Ukraine since 2014 also helped to conceal the Russian build-up.<br>Trump had not understood that the US-Russia pact gave Putin the right to intervene militarily in Ukraine, but any discussions on the exact meaning of the pact became purely academic when Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 1 January 2018. The first phase of the attack began with one amphibious group landing on the shores of Odessa from the Black Sea, one operative manoeuvre group moving from Rostov-on-Don towards Dnipro, and another from Voronezh to Kharkiv. Making a pre-emptive strike, and taking advantage of the chaos in Kyiv, the Russian air force overwhelmed and neutralised the Ukrainian air force in the first 24 hours of the conflict. To cut the capital off from Western support, Russian paratroopers landed west of Kyiv.<br>After an emergency European Council meeting, its president, Donald Tusk, told a packed hall of journalists that the leaders of the EU had met following news of Russia’s renewed aggression in Ukraine. He said that the EU condemned Russia’s actions and called for Moscow to pull back its forces. The EU would consider further measures as the situation evolved. Asked by a Politico correspondent whether the EU was taking any punitive steps against Russia, Tusk said that because of new bilateral security arrangements member states had been pursuing, there was, at that time, no agreement on measures against Russia.<br>In the middle of the press conference, iPhones started buzzing with news that Russia had called a high-readiness manoeuvre of its nuclear forces, deploying land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles into firing positions, and sending strategic bombers to patrol the coasts of Germany and France. Merkel and Macron called Trump to convince him of the danger and the need to push back against this nuclear posturing, but their efforts were in vain. On its own, Europe would not risk a nuclear confrontation with Russia over Ukraine.<br>The initial military operation in Ukraine went smoothly for the Kremlin. But after the first week, it became bogged down. Ukrainian armed forces managed to destroy all bridges across the Dnieper river, halting the Russian advance. Some Ukrainian units deployed to the Anti-Terrorist Operation zone in Donetsk, and units in Luhansk managed to delay the advance of Russian forces towards the Dnieper river, setting up pockets of Ukrainian resistance on the eastern bank. Former Ukrainian volunteer formations and dispersed Ukrainian army personnel set up resistance units attacking land-bound supply lines used by the Russian armed forces. With the cooperation of the local population, Ukrainian forces also effectively isolated the Russian paratroopers in the west of the country.<br>Surprisingly heavy losses during the first months of the conflict caused Russia to change its modus operandi. Instead of aiming for a quick victory, the Russian armed forces shifted to their long game, resting on the superior firepower of their artillery and air force to slowly break through any resistance. Despite Ukrainian attempts to subdue them, Russian forces gradually moved westwards towards Kyiv.<br>The number of internally displaced persons was in the millions, with the majority trying to reach Poland and Slovakia. Much of western Ukraine held out against Russian forces because its mountainous terrain posed a challenge for Russian military hardware, and because the Kremlin expected even stiffer resistance there. Instead of facing Russian military advances, Ukraine’s already-poor western provinces had to deal with the stream of refugees coming from the east. Western humanitarian assistance could only prevent the worst of this humanitarian catastrophe.<br>European civil society engaged in humanitarian aid efforts for refugees in western Ukraine and in Europe. This led to negative reactions from Moscow, as even engaging in Ukraine for humanitarian reasons was perceived by Moscow as illegal meddling in its sphere of influence. Some of the refugees turned back to join the Ukrainian resistance after they had brought their families to shelter in the West. They were accompanied by European volunteer troops, particularly from Poland, the Baltic states, and Scandinavian countries.<br>To dissuade Europe from any further engagement in Ukraine, Russia stepped up military provocations on NATO’s eastern flank. While the Kremlin could not afford another war in addition to its Ukrainian adventure, it did engage in ‘fly-bys’, airspace incursions, and simulated nuclear attacks to

. But as Russian society began to mobilise, hearing constant news reports about the number of dead soldiers coming back from Ukraine, anti-war protests sprang up in Russia. When war veterans and security personnel began to join the protests, the Kremlin stepped up its provocative actions against the Baltic countries and Poland, claiming that it was the one being attacked and that Russia was, in fact, at war with NATO.<br>Eastern European states felt directly threatened by Russian provocations and began to react to them. Finland and Sweden decided it was time to hold referendums on joining NATO. The most salient argument from the ‘No’ camp was that joining was now pointless since NATO had become obsolete. But the move towards membership caused Russia to further escalate its attempts to intimidate them. In light of the US retreat from its role as guarantor of European security, Poland openly considered leaving the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and developing indigenous nuclear capability to guarantee its own security. Finally, the EU agreed to co-finance French nuclear weapons and signed a nuclear-sharing agreement with France. Moscow took this step as a pretext to exit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty – signed at the end of the cold war to ban all long-range nuclear missiles – and forward-deploy nuclear weapons to Belarus, Crimea, and Kaliningrad. While the situation after the annexation of Crimea might have been a ‘cold war-lite’, Europe found itself back to the future: in a new and dangerous cold war proper.<br>Conclusion<br>This essay presents a series of pessimistic doomsday scenarios. Europe’s unity is more resilient and its capacity to navigate treacherous waters is greater than that which is set out here. But some of the events described are unfolding in the real world right now. The evaporation of US interest and influence in Ukraine since Donald Trump took office (and the lack of US pressure on Kyiv to move ahead with reforms) has led to a partial roll-back of reform legislation, an increase in police abuse, and selective investigations against critical politicians in Ukraine. Trump’s stated intention to strike a deal with Russia, suggestions that the US would drop sanctions, and his ambiguity over US security guarantees for Europe have, so far, pushed Europeans closer together and made them more committed to looking after their own security. But this unity could crumble should the US actually take steps towards making a grand bargain with Russia or disengaging from NATO.<br>European leaders have little choice but to try to compensate for the absence of US leadership on Ukraine. This task rests primarily with Germany. It seems increasingly likely that Berlin will need to carry the stick that the Obama administration wielded in Ukraine. And while much of the attention in Berlin has been on the implementation of the Minsk agreements, the nitty-gritty detail of reform implementation and reform assistance is the actual battleground that matters. This is where Berlin needs to assert itself in a much more prominent, visible, and intrusive way. Emmanuel Macron may turn out to be a strong ally in this.<br>While the EU’s priority should be to press for further reforms, the Minsk process is important as a way to manage and contain the conflict and to give Ukraine the time it needs for reforms. The problem with the Minsk agreements is that, if they are implemented the wrong way, they would make Ukraine a dysfunctional state, destroy its democracy, and send Ukraine back several steps on its already shaky path towards modernisation. Europe has to steer clear of easy fixes and shortcuts on Minsk.<br>Moscow recognises the potentially debilitating power of the Minsk agreements for Ukraine, which is why Moscow continues to push Kyiv to implement its obligations while doing nothing to live up to its own obligations. Ultimately, Moscow has no intention of implementing Minsk. Rather, it sees Minsk as a useful tool for pressuring Kyiv to legitimise the separatists and formally bring them into Ukraine’s body politic. But the tremendous challenges surrounding Minsk implementation – and the low likelihood of it ever actually being implemented – is not a reason to give up on Minsk. It is, however, a reason to push Russia even harder to implement its own side of the bargain in a manner that does not undermine Ukraine.<br>The sanctions regime is one of the primary sources of pressure that the EU has on Russia. But this pressure is not so much about the negative impact on the Russian economy as it is about the symbolic value of Europe not accepting Russia’s actions in Ukraine as legitimate. The sanctions represent Europe’s commitment to protecting Ukraine’s territorial integrity and to resolving the conflict in the Donbas. Lifting the sanctions without Minsk having been implemented would send the signal that Europe has given up on Ukraine – which is exactly what Moscow is aiming for.<br>Criticism that the sanctions are not working because Russia is still fighting the war in the East misses the point. If anything, the answer to this criticism is that sanctions should be increased rather than lifted. While the political conditions for increasing sanctions are probably not in place, the EU should consider extending its renewal period from every six months to once a year or automating the renewal process. This would make the political conditionality of lifting sanctions once Minsk is fully implemented more credible and remove biannual opportunities for Moscow to split the EU. It would also allow for a healthier and more strategic discussion within the EU about what to do with Russia. The constant focus on sanctions means that there is little space for broader discussion about Europe’s strategy towards Russia. A firmer commitment to the conditionality around sanctions would also make it easier for more hawkish member states to discuss forms of selective engagement with Russia.<br>But the EU will face bigger issues if Washington decides to lift its sanctions. This will force the EU to consider whether the policy makes sense and can be effective without the US. It could lead to the EU’s unity on sanctions collapsing and, consequently, its overall policy towards Russia collapsing, as set out in scenario three.<br>Europe needs to resist the Russian narrative of Ukraine being a failed state. Although segments of Kyiv’s political class are still corrupt, the country has progressed against the odds. Without sustained European support, Ukraine’s struggle will be even more difficult and the negative fallout of this struggle will be bigger. Emboldened by its success in Ukraine, Russia will understand what is possible in other parts of the world. Given this situation, it is the West, ironically, that is the most liable to turn Ukraine into a failed state.<br>All scenarios outlined in this paper are based on extrapolations of mistakes the West makes. But it does not have to end this way. Europe could stay the course and remain vigilant on Russia and Ukraine. There is no reason to believe the transformation of Ukraine and other eastern neighbourhood states cannot succeed in the long run. But it will be a bumpy ride.</div>

As this round of negotiations progresses, here are four points to consider from a recent talk by Thomas Graham, a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former senior director for Russia on the National Security Council staff:<br>1. In the U.S., people think of Russia’s military build-up near Ukraine as

<br>2. Russia is looking for a negotiated solution to the crisis. Although Moscow is keeping open multiple military options, the least likely of these is a large-scale invasion.<br>3. Russia is in a fairly strong position, in part because of disarray in the West.<br>4. The U.S. is in an unsustainable position in terms of both process and substance. Washington must accept that (a) bilateral deal-making with Russia will play a decisive role in resolving the crisis and (b) the talks will have to cover a much broader array of issues than just Ukraine—chief among these, NATO expansion, military activity along the Russian-NATO frontier and conflicts current and frozen.<br>To read Graham’s recommendations for breaking the impasse between Russia and the West over European security, click here.<br>Photo courtesy of Russia's Foreign Ministry.</div>

. We all agreed the stakes are too high to let the relationship deteriorate further and we proposed several areas of potential cooperation.<br>First, in the area of arms control, our countries bear a unique responsibility for strategic stability, not just bilaterally but globally. The coming expiration of the New START Treaty provides a timely occasion, and disagreements over compliance with the INF Treaty provide an important impulse, to return to the strategic arms negotiating table. Although we should realize that the world has changed and that our two countries cannot alone define the terms of strategic stability for the rest of the world, in this area we have a unique and essential role to play. Strengthening strategic stability should go hand in hand with efforts to increase predictability and transparency of NATO and Russian conventional military activities and deployments in Europe.<br>Second, to address the conflict in Ukraine, our countries can start by naming special envoys from Moscow and Washington to restore a structural and sustained element to bilateral discussions and more effectively participate in the existing multilateral process.  At present, the focus is on managing and containing the conflict, but when the time is more opportune for closing a deal, the contours of a solution should be in place. U.S. and Russian special envoys with presidential mandates, in consultation with Ukraine and other stakeholders, could work out a road map of steps in the political and military realms, as the Minsk Agreements do not fully define the sequencing or provide for an international enforcement mechanism. Although Crimea will likely remain a bone of contention for some time to come, resolution of the conflict in Donbas,

Other transnational threats, such as terrorism and international drug trafficking, are likewise areas where joint efforts could bear fruit.

 areas such as space exploration and scientific partnership more generally. Our joint work in sustaining the world’s only space colony and on the Arctic region, which continues despite the challenging atmosphere of the bilateral relationship provides a compelling example of what is possible. A renewal and intensification of scientific and cultural exchange programs would sustain and expand professional links and people-to-people ties vital to maintaining mutual understanding and capacity to manage differences at a time of U.S.-Russian tensions.<br>Finally, our group in Moscow reflected on the breakdown of institutionalized ties essential to sustaining productive cooperation between us. The Bilateral Presidential Commission is moribund and other structured channels of communication remain inadequate. Contacts between our militaries are insufficient and must be enhanced to minimize the danger of incidents where we are operating in close proximity to each other. Cooperation on the issues mentioned above is essential but at the same time is not enough to restore an abiding sense of trust in the bilateral relationship. Our own Congress should know that Russian parliamentary participants view the resumption of long dormant legislative contacts as an important priority.<br>The bilateral relationship has unfortunately been considered by leaders on both sides as a sort of

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in Moscow on Tuesday with perhaps more experience negotiating with Russians than any new secretary of state since John Quincy Adams — whose first diplomatic mission to Saint Petersburg preceded his admission to Harvard, and who served as our young republic’s first minister to the czarist court. Tillerson needs no advice on how to deal with Moscow, but he leaves behind a country riven by arguments about Russia. Democrats are furious over interference in the U.S. presidential election, whereas some Republicans have developed a blind spot in the weather eye they traditionally train on U.S. national security issues. Reestablishing a rough consensus on principles to guide American relations with Russia, therefore, is a high foreign policy priority. Five ideas might start that process.<br>First, except for a brief period in the 1990s, Russian and American political values are and have been deeply incompatible. America’s founding documents — the Declaration of Independence and Constitution — commit the country to democracy and respect for individual rights. Beneath a democratic veneer, President Vladimir Putin’s Russia is authoritarian, and committed to 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    “order”

 and 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    “security”
    <span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">Content</span>
</mark>
 at the expense of individual rights. The Russian government controls media outlets, especially television. It manipulates elections to make them noncompetitive. Rule of law is no protection for the assets and even the lives of those who run afoul of Putin. Consequently, Russia’s government derives no legitimacy from its ostensibly democratic procedures. Once, a booming oil industry granted legitimacy derived from prosperity, but no more. Increasingly, nationalism — truly the last resort of scoundrels — is the source of Putin’s claim to legitimacy.<br>This dynamic instills a profound sense of insecurity in Moscow, with the very existence of liberal democracies serving as a daily argument against the legitimacy of the Russian government. This is likely why Putin directed Russia’s intelligence services to meddle in U.S. and European elections. If all election processes are illegitimate, then Russia’s government is not disadvantaged, and authoritarian order may even outshine democratic chaos. The defeat of an American presidential candidate abhorred by Putin was probably an unexpected tactical victory in a broader strategic campaign to undermine the West. Until Russia values democracy, individual rights, and rule of law, Washington and Moscow’s policies will be animated by fundamentally different values.<br>Second, Russian and American interests are incompatible in many but not all cases. Russia is revanchist. For Putin, who saw the dissolution of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century — an era that included both Communism and Nazism, as well as two world wars — reestablishing a semblance of the Soviet Union’s security domain is a priority. Thus, Russia has effectively seized territory from Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, and furiously fought the right of all three nations, and others, to determine their own security policies. Most of all, Moscow seeks to crack European and transatlantic unity. The NATO alliance and European economic integration are emphatically in America’s interest. Hence, Russia opposes them.<br>Similarly, in Syria, Russian and American goals are far different. The United States seeks the defeat of the Islamic State and the establishment of a stable, democratic Syrian government that would permit the end of the brutal civil war and the return of refugees. Moscow seeks to preserve the Syrian government, employing Russian forces to eliminate all opposition. It also seeks to maintain its access to naval and air bases, and to minimize the risk from Muslim extremists returning to its territory. If the Islamic State kills off moderate alternatives to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, so much the better. The refugee flows into Europe, which stress democratic institutions there, advance Moscow’s interests.<br>On some matters, Russian and American interests coincide. Both countries seek to end radical Islamic terrorism. Both countries need to secure nuclear weapons and materials, and to work with third parties to do so. Both countries have an interest in a stable and transparent nuclear weapons balance, although Russia’s violation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty must be reversed.<br>Third, we should cooperate where we can, even as we compete where we must. President Richard Nixon deployed

 against the Soviet Union, but also pursued détente (admittedly, a steady policy between those extremes would have been optimal). President Ronald Reagan rightly saw the Soviet Union as

</mark>
 but also pursued the INF and Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty negotiations.<br>Fourth, we should be clear-eyed about both U.S. and Russian vital national security interests. U.S. alliances advance American security interests and values. They have promoted unprecedented peace and prosperity in Europe, Northeast Asia, and elsewhere for over half a century. They have diminished American burdens and increased American influence. They must be defended as vital interests.<br>Moscow too has vital security interests — albeit some which are distasteful. Yet if they were vital to Russia but peripheral to us, it would be better not to pursue them at all costs. This does not mean simply acceding to Moscow’s use of force. For five decades, the United States refused to recognize the Soviet Union’s seizure of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, mostly by placing an asterisk on official maps. The United States, however, chose not to risk World War III and the destruction of the countries in question by attempting to pry them away from the Soviet Union before its demise. Some sneered at this policy as an empty gesture, but today those nations are free and independent. Sometimes patience is a powerful weapon in the diplomatic arsenal. The greatest risk of war between the United States and Russia — the two most heavily armed countries in the world — stems from misjudging where each other’s vital interests lie. Prudent analysis and careful diplomacy are called for.<br>Finally, it is important to remember that no mortal government lasts forever, and Putin’s Russia is not the only viable model for Russia. The country is capable of democracy. Russia and the United States are not natural enemies. Until Russia changes of its own accord, however, we must deal with it as it is. That means recognizing the differences between U.S. and Russian values, fiercely defending those American interests that are vital, cooperating where we can, and refusing to be baited into conflicts that are not central to U.S. security. A bipartisan consensus behind these principles would make U.S. policy toward Russia more effective, regardless of which party controls the White House.<br>William Tobey is a senior fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and previously served as the deputy administrator for the Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation at the National Nuclear Security Administration from 2006-2009.<br>Photo credit: Flickr photo by the U.S. State Department shared as a U.S. government work.</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Despite claims this week from Russia that it has withdrawn some forces from along its border with Ukraine, a buildup of around 150,000 troops remains around the former Soviet republic and multiple rounds of talks between Russia and the West have failed to produce mutually agreeable off-ramps. The crisis has generated no shortage of speculation on the reasons behind the buildup and what may come next. Is this a ploy born out of Putin’s domestic political considerations? Could additional sanctions spark turmoil and public unrest? A look into the hearts and minds of the Russian population offers valuable context to better understand the ongoing crisis. While polls are not a perfect indicator of public opinion, recent surveys by the Levada Center help uncover a more nuanced, more complete range of Russian viewpoints than those widely known in the West. Taken together, these polls shed light on complex tensions that have persisted since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.<br>While much of the West views the current security crisis as a result of Russia’s military deployments and failure to engage meaningfully in recent diplomatic efforts, Russians perceive the course of events differently. According to a Levada Center poll published Dec. 14, 2021, half (50%) of those surveyed believe that the United States and other NATO countries initiated the aggravation of the situation in eastern Ukraine. Another 16% think that Ukraine was the initiator. Meanwhile, only 4% named Russia, and 3% said it was the unrecognized republics of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR) in eastern Ukraine, which are occupied by pro-Russian forces. There are likely a number of contributing factors that help explain this poll; it may speak to our vastly different cultural and historical perspectives, or to the success of Russian propagandistic tools to control the narrative at home. It also highlights classic aspects of the security dilemma familiar in NATO-Russian relations: one side’s efforts to bolster its security may not universally be perceived as defensive in nature.<br>An interesting Levada Center poll from March 2021 asked Russian citizens how they felt about the level of autonomy the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics presently have. The largest proportion (28%) of respondents said they thought the republics should become independent states, while 25% said they thought the republics should become part of Russia. Another 16% said that autonomy within Ukraine was enough, and 10% said the republics should be returned to Ukraine. Another 25% said it was hard to say. While it is true that 69% of respondents effectively support some degree of autonomy for the Donbass region, there is no clear frontrunner for a desired outcome. Instead, there are a range of results with very different political consequences. This nuance in opinion seems not fully appreciated by the West, which often oversimplifies Russian public sentiment or assumes the Russian populace is fully in line with its president.<br>A similar Levada Center poll from April 2021 asked Russian citizens if they would support the inclusion of the DPR and LPR into Russia if the republics were to request unification. The majority of those polled (65%) reported that they would at least somewhat support this (33% said definitely yes and 32% said somewhat). Meanwhile, only 15% said not really, and only 11% said definitely not.<br>Interestingly, while many Russians would support the unification of the Donbass region with Russia, far fewer seem to support military actions to achieve that goal. The same April 2021 poll also

 The results were much more evenly split. Only 43% of respondents reported that they believe Russia should intervene in a conflict (18% said definitely yes, 25% were somewhat supportive) and another 43% reported that Russia should not intervene (25% were not very supportive and 18% said definitely not). This perhaps implies that while many Russians would support the Donbass being united with Russia, they have a lower threshold for the deleterious effects associated with engaging in an armed conflict including casualties among the armed forces, potential escalation with Ukraine, NATO or the U.S. or the possible political and financial costs of the war.<br>According to the poll, age was also a factor. The support for hypothetical intervention was significantly stronger among the 55 and older age group; 54% said definitely yes or were somewhat supportive and only 34% said definitely not or were not very supportive. In younger populations aged 18-24, the idea of intervention in an armed conflict was much less popular: only 34% said definitely yes or were somewhat supportive, and more than half (53%) said definitely not or were not very supportive. Whatever the myriad potential causes for this difference may be--whether younger generations of Russians are generally more averse to war or because they are of military service age–further examination is warranted.<br>

 The largest proportion of respondents (42%) believe that attitudes will not change. A third of respondents (31%) reported that it would cause Russians to be dissatisfied with Putin. Only 16% of respondents reported it would increase Putin’s favorability. These findings may be particularly useful to Western audiences under the impression that Putin enjoys unconditional domestic support regardless of his actions, or that Putin is fomenting this crisis to boost his ratings at home. (In 2014, Putin’s approval rating rose from 69% in February to 80% in March.) These findings should also be contrasted with the overwhelming Russian support for Putin’s annexation of Crimea, which has consistently remained around 86% according to Levada data. Evidence suggests that Russians view the issues of Crimea and eastern Ukraine quite differently.<br>A March 2020 Levada Center poll showed that the overwhelming majority of Russians (87%) believe that existing Western sanctions against Russia did not create any serious problems for them personally or for their families. Only 10% of respondents reported the existence of serious problems due to sanctions. This may speak to the surprising resilience of the Russian economy against sanctions, born from tremendous sanctions-proofing efforts since 2014. And it may raise some doubt regarding the frequent postulation that further sanctions will cause public unrest. On one hand, if the West were to respond with various proposed unprecedented sanctions, this could change, and would likely play into Moscow’s fear that the West will foment a color revolution within its borders. However, a Jan. 26 Levada Center poll showed that 66% of respondents are not very worried about possible Western political and economic sanctions against Russia due to the Ukraine crisis; the largest proportion of respondents (35%) said not at all and 31% said not very. Nineteen percent said they were quite worried and 13% responded that they were very worried.<br>Despite anti-Russian sanctions and a tenuous history, polls report that 79% of respondents think that Russia should improve relations with the United States and other Western countries.

 16% said as an opponent, 11% said as a friend and only 3% said as an enemy. These figures have been generally consistent since 2016. Both of these polls suggest a persistent popular sentiment among Russians that the country should cooperate with the West despite effusive anti-West propaganda and fallout since 2014-2015. While each of the polls highlighted in this article warrants further examination, this may be a welcome reminder that Moscow’s harsh, anti-Western rhetoric is not always indicative of how its people feel.<br>The West has a tendency to oversimplify Russian viewpoints by veering toward either extreme of the spectrum, such as

 While relatively homogeneous Russian public opinion polls are often used as evidence to further support an existing argument, there are a variety of underappreciated nuances among Russian public opinion that merit further analysis. For example, while Russians generally support some degree of autonomy for the Donbass, they are far more split when it comes to supporting such a military campaign. Each of these polls sheds light on Russian perceptions of key aspects of the developing crisis and enhances our understanding of dynamics presently at play.<br>Mary Chesnut is an associate research analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses’ (CNA) Russia Studies Program.<br>The opinions expressed herein are solely those of the author. Photo by putnik shared under a Creative Commons license.</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Russia wants better relations with the US; Donald Trump wants better relations with Russia, too. But as Trump’s campaign theme music continues to remind us, you can’t always get what you want. Here are the top 5 reasons no one should expect a Russia-US rapprochement.<br>1. NATO<br>Ukraine Says Russian Missiles Hit Another Apartment Building 0:00 / 0:00<br>Getting NATO countries to pay more on defense has been one of Trump’s few consistent foreign policy proposals—and one of the least controversial, given that just five of NATO’s 28 countries (US, Greece, the UK, Estonia and Poland) meet the 2-percent-of-GDP defense spending target. But here’s the thing—if you demand that other NATO members pay more money, and then those NATO countries agree, the alliance becomes stronger, not weaker.<br>Russia doesn’t want a stronger NATO—as evidenced by Moscow sending a spy ship 30 miles off the US eastern seaboard and Russian jets buzzing an American warship in the Black Sea, both in February. Provocative military actions don’t build good relations.<br>2. Trump’s Cabinet<br>Defense establishment figures within the Trump administration also limit the potential for US-Russian security cooperation, the center of any potential warming of US-Russia relations, since there is already very little trade between the two countries. During his confirmation hearings, Defense Secretary James Mattis pointed to Russia and Vladimir Putin as one of the principal geopolitical threats facing the US today. Trump’s choice for CIA Director, Mike Pompeo, began his own confirmation hearings by decrying Russia’s interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The resignation of pro-Russia National Security Adviser Michael Flynn less than a month later (at 24 days, the shortest tenure in history) only compounded the issue—

Russian Domestic Politics<br>Aware of these issues, Russian official attitudes toward the White House are changing. Much was made of the early positive press Trump received from Russian TV stations, from which 80 percent of Russians get their news. For a moment, Trump seemed to be getting better press coverage than Putin—in January, Trump was mentioned 202,000 times in Russian mainstream media news coverage compared to Putin’s 147,7000. It was the first time in six years that anybody surpassed Putin for that honor.<br>But things began to sour in February on the heels of Flynn’s resignation, coupled with damage-control comments from the White House that Trump expected

 Flynn resigned on February 13th; between February 5th and February 19th, Trump mentions fell by 88 percent on those all-important Russian Sunday news shows. It wouldn’t be surprising if the cutback in Trump coverage was ordered directly from the Kremlin, which can’t continue to praise Trump and raise public expectations for better relations if they aren’t actually going to improve.<br>4. Oil<br>Donald Trump is a pro-oil president, for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with Russia but impact its government just the same. Trump’s bid to eliminate Obama’s environmental rules and push for more production is close to the last thing that oil-export-dependent Russia needs right now. The Russian economy relied on oil and natural gas to fund nearly 50 percent of its fiscal revenues last year. Given that level of exposure, even small fluctuations in oil prices have big implications for the Russian economy—one that’s been reeling since 2013 and that’s lost more than 40 percent of its GDP as oil has tumbled from its mid-2014 high of $115 per barrel to $50 today. The world is already facing an oversupply of oil, and though market factors are driving production decisions for US oil companies, Trump’s oil-friendly environmental policies could boost production at the margins and help push prices lower. This is a good reminder that, though Trump and Putin may admire one another and want warmer relations, divergent national interests still matter.<br>5. The Elephant in the Room<br>Questions about Russia’s role in the US election aren’t going away. FBI Director James Comey confirmed this week that the FBI is investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, as well as possible cooperation between Russian intelligence and the Trump campaign. The White House maintains that there’s no fire, only smoke generated by illegal leaks and a biased mainstream media. That’s certainly possible—but it’s worth remembering that most fire deaths aren’t caused by burns, but by smoke inhalation.<br>***<br>The good news for Trump? Better relations with Putin would probably drag his already historically-low approval ratings down even further. You can’t always get what you want—but sometimes you get what you need.

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">The idea du jour circulating inside the Trump administration and among terrorism experts and Syria watchers alike is that ISIS cannot be destroyed in Syria unless Bashar al-Assad is removed from power and Iran’s presence and influence are drastically curtailed. And in a perfect world, this indeed would be the best possible outcome to prevent ISIS and other jihadi groups, including Al Qaeda, from ensconcing themselves there. But needless to say, the Middle East isn’t a perfect world. U.S. retaliation against another chemical-weapons attacks, as the White House threatened late Monday, would be both necessary and justified. (Assad and his military would

.) But pursuing an ambitious mission against Iran, Assad and the Russians in Syria is dangerous, imprudent and unnecessary to protect vital American security interests. Here are five compelling reasons why.<br>The United States Can’t Eradicate ISIS in Syria<br>In his inaugural address, President Trump spoke about eradicating radical Islamic terrorism from the face of the earth. It cannot be done. Syria alone will remain an incubator for jihadists and Salafists of all stripes due to a toxic brew of poor governance, bleak economic opportunities, sectarian hatreds and beleaguered Sunni communities. And its ideology and propaganda will still be able to feed on the resentments and sense of victimhood and grievance among the Sunni population. Those who argue for a more assertive policy in Syria are right that, unless these problems are addressed, ISIS and other jihadi groups will continue to thrive even without the caliphal proto-state. But even the most risk inclined in the Trump administration cannot envision that kind of U.S. commitment in Syria, which would entail the United States and its allies committing thousands of troops and billions of dollars to militarily defeat all of their adversaries in Syria and to occupy, stabilize and reconstruct the country. Indeed, the president himself has strongly argued against nation building. Containing jihadists is realistic; ridding them from Syria is a pipe dream.<br>There’s No Foreseeable Stable End State for Syria<br>The idea that confronting Iran or trying to weaken the Assad regime in an effort to remove him from power or force him into a negotiated political transition is chimerical. That’s been evident for several years. Even if the United States made a commitment to take Assad out, it would lead to more chaos, no organized force aligned with the West to replace him and a mad scramble among all kinds of groups—Sunni jihadists like ISIS and Al Qaeda, pro-Iranian Shia militias, Alawites and Kurds—to consolidate control over real estate, making the situation worse. Assad was unprepared for a negotiated political transition before Russia’s intervention in 2015 helped turn the tide in his favor. He certainly would never agree to such an outcome now that he controls most of the critical cities and regions in Syria. Moreover, the Russians, who may ultimately want a political solution as an exit strategy, don’t seem to be in a hurry for one—and Moscow won’t be pressured and intimidated into accepting one, given what it has invested in Syria. Thus, even if getting rid of ISIS, in theory, means ridding Syria of Assad and Alawite domination, reducing Sunni grievances and stemming Iran’s influence, it simply isn’t feasible at a cost the American Congress and public are willing to pay. And if there is no attainable stable end state, the Trump administration’s moves to deepen military and civilian involvement in Syria need to be carefully weighed and evaluated against the precise objectives that an escalating commitment is designed to achieve. Those who are pushing for a more aggressive role in Syria have never identified the relationship between more U.S. engagement and any conceivable end state.<br>We Don’t Want a War with Iran<br>Iran is run by a repressive regime. It abuses human rights, has expansionist aims and sponsors terrorist acts throughout the Middle East. But trying to roll back Iran’s influence in Syria looks a lot easier in theory than in practice. Those pushing to eject Iran from southeastern Syria and stymie its efforts to control border crossings between Iraq and Syria—with the intention of creating a land bridge to the Mediterranean—have yet to demonstrate how any of this would contribute to the defeat of ISIS. Nor have they been forthright about the forces it would take to achieve these goals and sustain control over the region. One White House official recently referred to the creation of a Rat Patrol modelled after the 1960s TV show depicting a bunch of tough U.S. soldiers riding around in jeeps and harassing German soldiers in the North African desert. The administration is also planning to send a seven-member team to provide humanitarian assistance to areas in southeastern Syria that have been liberated from Islamic State control. All of this amounts to tactical gimmicks bound to fail, not a strategy. The administration’s Syria policies are untethered to any broader set of goals for combating ISIS and other jihadi groups—a goal that Iran shares more urgently, given the recent terror attack in Tehran. Moreover, ramping up a more aggressive and escalatory policy against Iran might jeopardize the nuclear accord. That agreement is far from perfect, but it will significantly slow down Iran’s march toward a nuclear-weapons capability for the next ten to fifteen years. Indeed, with the North Korean nuclear file very much open, the last thing the United States needs is another outlier state pushing to join the nuclear club.<br>The United States Can’t Sideline Russia<br>Fears that the United States and Russia will slide into a full-scale war over Syria are overblown because both fully appreciate the potentially catastrophic consequences. But continued escalation of military incidents involving U.S. and Russian forces in Syria will make it all but impossible for the two countries to work out any kind of modus vivendi for stabilizing the country after Raqqa falls to U.S. and coalition forces. Russia confronts Washington with several inconvenient truths: first, it’s in a much stronger military and diplomatic position than the United States. Second, because Putin has the upper hand it is hard to imagine that he (or the Assad regime) will be amenable to imposing any meaningful restrictions on Assad’s freedom of action. Nor is Putin likely to accept any kind of international presence in Syria for peacekeeping, stabilization and reconstruction that undermines their control. Third, Moscow will be critical to establishing the political and economic arrangements that will be required for stabilization and reconstruction. In short, any kind of post-conflict cooperation with Moscow in Syria will not be possible if the United States tries to put the squeeze on Russia. Those who argue that pressure on Moscow is the only way to change Putin’s calculations ignore the president’s seeming unwillingness to tangle with him, the unwillingness of the United States to apply serious pressure and Putin’s willingness to push back if necessary.<br>U.S. Interests in Syria Aren’t as Vital as Those of Its Adversaries<br>No matter how important Syria is to the United States (and an argument can be made that it’s not all that important), Washington needs to decide how much it’s prepared to sacrifice and whether it’s ready to stay the course when Iran and Russia push back. There’s an elemental divide between the way the United States sees this issue and those who live in or close to the region: whether it’s Iran, Turkey, Israel, Jordan and the Gulf Arabs, they seem prepared to sacrifice far more than the United States. They know their neighborhood better, geography and demography give them key advantages, and for many the stakes are existential in a way they’ll never be for America. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Syria: Assad is fighting for his survival; Syria may not be as vital to Iran as Iraq is, but Tehran has already sacrificed huge resources, men and material to the fight; and Putin didn’t project Russia’s military power into Syria only to fold in the face of U.S. pressure. The reality is that the Syria-Iran-Russia coalition is much more a coalition of the willing than the alliance the United States has managed to assemble, which seems more like a coalition of the semi-willing and self-interested. The argument that the only way to change Russian or Iranian calculations is to escalate the pressure is a dangerous game, given the disparity in will, interests and allies that exists between the two sides. Who’d blink first, given the absence of congressional and public support for another military adventure with no end state (see Afghanistan and Iraq)?<br>Like Afghanistan where the United States is now also stuck, Washington will likely need to settle for a good-enough outcome, certainly not a victory. What this means now is impossible to say. After all, the United States has been in Afghanistan for a decade and a half, and still doesn’t know if anything resembling sustainable success is in the cards.<br>Still, the primary goal in Syria must continue to be weakening and containing jihadi groups, keeping them on their heels to prevent attacks on the United States, Europe and regional allies. This is not an optimal outcome, but it’s far more preferable than pursuing unrealistic and unrealizable goals that could drag the United States into endless and distracting wars it cannot win against far more committed and determined adversaries. Managing rather than eliminating the jihadist threat in Syria is neither a pretty nor heroic strategy, and it certainly won’t fix Syria or deal Iran a strategic blow. But for America, it’s the right approach, particularly when considering the risks and downsides of taking on Syria and Iran in these contested areas. And there are hopeful signs that the Pentagon at least is well aware of these dangers.</div>

Russia has a penchant for causing domestic political trouble in other countries through conveniently timed cyber hacks (just ask the United States ). The Turkish government has been on the receiving end of such hacks before; on Dec. 7, Wikileaks released over 57,000 emails of Berat Albayrak, Turkey’s minister of energy and natural resources and also President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s son-in-law. With indications of Russia cooperating with Wikileaks to publicize hacked emails in the past, Russian cyber surrogates could target Turkey, revealing more unflattering secrets about people in the orbit of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.<br>The already fragile relationship between Russia and Turkey could fall apart, leading to renewed economic pressure on Turkey . This is what happened after November 2015, when Turkish F-16s shot down a Russian bomber on the border of Syria. In response, Russia embargoed many Turkish goods, Turkish exports to Russia fell $737 million. Further, the Turkish Stream natural gas pipeline, meant to be part of the two countries’

 was put on hold. The economic situation did not improve until Erdogan apologized in June 2016 .<br>The assassination is used as an excuse for further democratic repression in both Turkey and Russia. Erdogan detained thousands after the failed coup against his government this July, a putsch that included an attempt on his own life. Putin came to power in part by cracking down against perceived insubordination by violence in Chechnya. Whatever else, the assassination does not bode well for Russian or Turkish civil society.<br>The ceasefire in Aleppo collapses. Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides of the Syrian civil war, but both helped broker the latest ceasefire that allowed rebels and civilians to leave Aleppo. The assassination could cause the ceasefire collapse anew, or lead to renewed fighting elsewhere in Syria. Russian forces are operational in northeast Syria, not far from where Turkish troops have taken part in cross-border assaults on towns held by the Islamic State.<br>Russia plays the Kurdish card. Turkey is a NATO member, making it highly unlikely that Russia would consider starting an out and out war with Turkey itself. Karlov is probably not, in other words, another Archduke Franz Ferdinand. But Russia could use its historical ties with disaffected Kurdish populations in Turkey, including possible support for Kurdish militants , spurring more Kurdish terror attacks. On Saturday, a car bombing in central Turkey killed 13 soldiers and wounded 55. And on Dec. 11, two bombs went off in Istanbul that killed 39 and wounded 154. A Kurdish militant group claimed credit for the Istanbul attacks.<br>Update, Dec. 19 2016, 3:23 PM: This story was updated to include statements from the Turkish, Russian, and U.S. governments.<br>Photo credit: Ramil Sitdikov/Host Photo Agency via Getty Images</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">On Monday morning, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort turned himself in to federal authorities. The New York Times‘ Matt Apuzzo reported that his arrest is part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.<br>Here is a video of Manafort and his lawyer walking into the FBI office.<br>Paul Manafort and his longtime protege Richard Gates were indicted by a federal grand jury on 12 counts: conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading FARA statements, and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts. The indictment included no explicitly campaign-related charges.<br>Here are five things to keep in mind about Manafort amidst this revelation.<br>1. He was in bed with the Russians from the beginning.<br>When Donald Trump hired Paul Manafort as his convention manager, PJ Media reported Manafort’s close relationship with former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Yanukovych supported Russian President Vladimir Putin at a time when most Ukrainians wanted to join the EU. After he became president (thanks in part to Manafort’s convention expertise) in 2010, Yanukovych was ousted by protesters in 2014.<br>Manafort first entered the world of Russian oligarchs in 2006, when he began working for Oleg Deripaska, who has close ties with Putin. Manafort made $10 million per year under Deripaska, according to The Washington Post, and he also got hired by Yanukovych’s pro-Putin Party of Regions around that time.<br>Last August, a ledger from the Party of Regions listed $12.7 million in cash payments designated for Manafort between 2007 and 2012. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine also reported investigating Yanukovych for a group of offshore shell companies. The former president reportedly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, including a palace with a private zoo, golf course, and tennis court.<br>2. Why Trump hired Manafort.<br>Such revelations bring special emphasis to the question of why Donald Trump hired Manafort in the first place. Did Trump intend to give Russia a seat at the table in his campaign?<br>The timing of Manafort’s hiring and demotion (and subsequent resignation) suggests something else. Manafort first earned his reputation as a master of political conventions at the Republican National Committee in 1980, when he helped Ronald Reagan secure the Republican nomination.<br>Manafort’s experience with Yanukovych — shady as it was — also demonstrated his prowess at getting controversial candidates through the convention process.<br>Trump hired Manafort mere months before the Republican National Convention, and at the time, there was serious chatter about using convention rules to deny Trump the Republican nomination. Shortly after the convention went off without a hitch, Trump demoted Manafort, who subsequently resigned.<br>Trump’s decision to hire Manafort may have been a grievous mistake, but in terms of the challenge at hand and the most likely reason Trump hired Manafort, the decision proved successful. It seems that Trump made the calculation that it was worth it to hire a man with a shady past, so long as he could get the job done.<br>The timing suggests Trump did not hire Manafort in order to

 with Russia, but to win at the Republican National Convention. More revelations may suggest otherwise, but the mere act of hiring Manafort does not prove

<br>3. The wiretap.<br>Manafort was (rightly) under surveillance before the 2016 election, but the probity of the U.S. government snooping on Manafort became suspect when he joined Trump’s campaign.<br>Last month, CNN reported that Manafort was wiretapped before and after the election, spying that continued into early this year, when Manafort was known to be speaking with President Trump.<br>A court working under the auspices of the Foreign Intelligence Service Act (FISA) ordered wiretapping of Trump campaign officials, but the FISA order began when Manafort became the subject of an FBI investigation that began in 2014. The surveillance was paused in 2016 for lack of evidence, but then resumed after a new FISA warrant was obtained.<br>Manafort resigned in August of last year, but he continued to speak with Trump afterward.

<br>While the first wiretap began in 2014 as a result of investigations into Yanukovych, the second wiretap began in the run-up to the 2016 campaign. With President Barack Obama still in office, and firmly behind Donald Trump’s opposition, this raised issues of propriety — even though Manafort has confirmed connections to Putin’s international money-laundering.<br>4. The FBI raid.<br>The FBI raided Manafort’s Virginia home in July, in a way that was 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

</mark>
 The raid began while Manafort and his wife were sleeping, lasted ten hours, and involved a dozen federal agents.<br>The agents entered Manafort’s condo without warning at about 6 a.m. Eastern and did not leave until around 4 p.m. Eastern. The raid came the same week Manafort appeared before the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees and provided documents on a voluntary basis.<br>As more evidence surfaces in the Manafort case, the FBI will likely reveal why the raid occurred. Perhaps such measures were indeed necessary to convict Manafort.<br>5. Does this spell doom for Clinton allies?<br>At least one of the charges on which Manafort was indicted should spark fear in some notable allies of Hillary Clinton. The charge of misleading FARA statements — lying on documents required by the Federal Agents Registration Act — might also apply to Tony Podesta, who co-founded the Podesta Group with Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign manager John Podesta, and who served as a Clinton bundler last year.<br>Earlier this month, Mueller broadened his investigation to include Tony Podesta and the Podesta Group. According to anonymous sources cited by NBC News, the Podesta investigation began as a fact-finding mission into Manafort’s role with a pro-Ukraine nonprofit during Yanukovych’s tenure. The Podesta Group also served that nonprofit.<br>The Mueller probe has reportedly launched a criminal inquiry into whether the Podesta Group also violated FARA, an allegation PJ Media reported last April. While failure to register as a lobbyist on behalf of foreign governments under FARA is not usually heavily enforced, the circumstances of this case give FARA violations a particular gravity.<br>The arrests of Manafort and Gates are not good news for President Trump, but they do not necessarily prove the “collusion” narrative. More information will have to be unearthed in order to address the broader claim that the Trump campaign worked with Russia to undermine the election.<br>Recent bombshells about Hillary Clinton should also not be forgotten. This month, it was revealed that the FBI kept an investigation into the Russian firm Rosatom secret, just at the time when Hillary Clinton was considering approving the Uranium One deal — and when her husband received a hefty payment from a bank supporting Uranium One. At the same time, the FBI acted quickly to bust a Russian spy ring because it got too close to Clinton.<br>Worse, it was revealed that the Clinton campaign and the DNC hired Fusion GPS and former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the Trump-Russia dossier, which was later used to obtain FISA court approval for surveillance.<br>Furthermore, the Clinton campaign and the DNC now face an FEC complaint because they listed payments to the law firm Perkins Coie (through which they hired Fusion GPS) as paying for 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

 not opposition research. This further legal violation raises questions about what the Clinton campaign was trying to hide.<br>Fusion GPS also worked with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Is it possible the Clinton campaign tried to set up the infamous meeting between Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Veselnitskaya?<br>The Manafort arrest is bad news for Trump, but it does not prove the “collusion” narrative. Federal investigations usually do not stop with the initial indictments, so it is likely others will be arrested as well. Mueller could call more Trump associates, but he could also call Tony Podesta.</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">When the crystal ball dropped in Times Square this past Saturday, millions of people in New York threw the confetti, kissed their loved ones and sang Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York,” with an eye towards a more hopeful future. Tens of millions of additional Americans across the country celebrated with a huge sigh of relief that 2016 came to an end; the year was bizarre, exciting, historic and fantastical all rolled into one. The topper of course was a real estate developer, reality television star and tabloid hound named Donald J. Trump beating the Republican and Democratic establishments with nothing but his propensity to rile a crowd, his Twitter account and his emotional connection to America’s working class.<br>How could this year, indeed any year, possibly be as historic as 2016?<br>Here are five stories to watch as the months go by:<br>1. Putin the peacemaker: In the eyes of the west (excluding the rightist populist parties that are rising in Europe), Vladimir Putin is a former intelligence officer who is as cunning and clever as he is brutal. Imagine Putin cuddling with a cute, little puppy and…well…it’s practically unimaginable. The man has silenced his domestic political opponents, allegedly authorized the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and partnered with the Iranians to completely level one of the most iconic cities in the Middle East in order to strengthen the negotiating hand of a despot.<br>But the Russian president is beginning to get into the peace game. A few days before 2016 came to a close, Putin partnered with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to establish Syria’s third ceasefire agreement in twelve months — a deal that included a complete halt to any 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    “attacks with any weapons, including rockets, mortars, and anti-tanks guided missiles,”
    <span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">Content</span>
</mark>
 and a halt to airstrikes from the Assad regime. The deal includes a ceasefire mechanism whereby the guarantors will monitor the terms of the truce along key points of contact, and recommend sanctions or punishments to the parties if and when violations occur. The truce is largely holding over its first couple of days, which means that political talks scheduled for January 15 in Astana could in fact proceed as planned. How ironic would it be if (a big IF) the talks actually generated a political transition agreement among the parties, with Vladimir Putin in line for a Nobel Prize?<br>2. Putin-Trump relations deteriorate: At the present time, Vladimir Putin and President-elect Donald Trump are about as buddy-buddy as two men who’ve never met can be. Putin holds off on retaliatory expulsions of U.S. diplomats after President Obama enacted sanctions for Moscow’s alleged cyber hacking, and

</mark>
 Trump continues to doubt Russia’s involvement in the hacking — despite intelligence community assessments to the contrary — and Putin returns the favor by openly looking forward to a golden era in U.S.-Russia relations over the next four years.<br>But no personal relationship in the world can compensate for the dramatically divergent national interests that divide the United States from Russia. Although Washington and Moscow may find some accommodation in Syria on counterterrorism, Russia will not simply cower for the sake of maintaining a friendship with America’s next commander-in-chief. Just as likely as a detente or outright rapprochement is Putin testing the waters to see what he can get away with. Renewed separatist violence in Eastern Ukraine? It’s possible. Continued intransigence in the UN Security Council? Very likely. Picking and probing along NATO’s eastern border? Anything could happen.<br>Will Trump be as jovial with Putin when he insults the billionaire’s intelligence or does something that the Trump administration considers a stab in the back? Will Trump’s reset with Russia be as successful as George W. Bush’s and Barack Obama’s?<br>3. Talks with North Korea: Democrats and Republicans disagree on many things, but most would tell you that the Obama administration’s policy on North Korea has been at best a continuation of U.S. policy failure and at worst a big stepping-stone to the permanence of the North as a nuclear weapons state. Trump hasn’t said much about North Korea other than labeling Kim Jong-un 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

</mark>
 but also a maniac who is capable enough of keeping North Korea’s generals in line. But we also know that Trump has an interest in the subject; according to Reuters, Trump actually requested a special intelligence briefing on Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program.<br>Be on the lookout for something big, bold and unprecedented from the dealmaker-in-chief — perhaps an administration overture to the North Koreans that would include the dispatching of senior U.S. officials to Pyongyang in order to determine whether direct, bilateral negotiations would be worth the time and effort. As silly as this may seem at the present time, it wouldn’t be altogether unusual to see a businessman who thinks he can get the deal of a lifetime to explore the outlines of a comprehensive understanding with Pyongyang on the nuclear question. What that arrangement may entail (a verifiable dismantlement of the North’s entire program; an interim cap on nuke development and missile testing; the signing of a formal peace treaty) is anyone’s guess. But the doctrine of strategic patience may very well be replaced with a doctrine of strategic engagement.<br>4. GOP vs. Trump: The relationship between congressional Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump is being portrayed by GOP spokespeople as one of unflinching harmony towards a brighter, more conservative future. And yet it would be the height of naivety to think that this kumbaya moment will last. Because it won’t.<br>On everything from border security, deportation policy and immigration reform to a partnership with the Kremlin and the importance of defending the liberal international order, the Trump White House and its Republican colleagues in the House and Senate will be battling in some fashion this year. We could even see GOP infighting in the first few weeks of the new year when Trump’s cabinet nominees face grilling during their confirmation hearings. Instead of the usual Tea Party-GOP establishment-Democratic divides, we could see a Washington divided amongst Trump loyalists, fiscal conservatives, Democrats and GOP establishment types. This isn’t exactly a recipe for productivity in government.<br>5. The end of the two-state solution: Last week, Secretary of State John Kerry sent a disturbing, but accurate, message: without an end to Israeli settlement-building deep in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and an end to violence directed at Israeli civilians, the two-state solution will be dead and buried sooner rather than later.

<br>If the Trump administration’s policies towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are at all similar to the views espoused by David Friedman, Trump’s nominee for ambassador to Israel, then the two-state formula that U.S. policy has been based on for the last five decades will indeed be dead. Any further action by the Security Council censuring Israeli settlement construction certainly won’t occur over the next four years. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu isn’t exactly in a giving mood towards the Palestinians; in fact, pro-settler parties in Netanyahu's coalition government are celebrating Trump’s tenure as the final nail in the two-state solution’s coffin. All of this will add up to more Palestinian disenfranchisement, more referrals from the Palestinian Authority to the International Criminal Court and greater radicalization on both sides of the 1967 line.<br>Daniel R.

Looking at the costs of Russia’s incursions in the Crimean peninsula and Eastern Ukraine since 2014, they are very high—and rising. Today, Russia faces increasing economic sanctions and political isolation. If anything, Russia’s self-described success in Ukraine was a Pyrrhic victory.<br>Second, even though relations between Russia and the West are strained, there is quite a lot of day-to-day cooperation. This state of affairs reflects the fact that Western states—or Europe as a whole—cannot be secure without some sort of a long-term diplomatic understanding with Russia. Both sides recognize this. Recently diplomacy has been underrated, but that does not mean that one should stop trying. Finland has been one of the few European countries engaging Russia at the highest political level in order to lower tensions. Waiting for Russia to capitulate in front of more and more economic sanctions or to expect it to disintegrate peacefully through a process of internal turmoil would be a mistake. Both Russia and the West have an interest in solving the ongoing crisis without recourse to the force of arms.<br>Finally, Finland and Sweden take their territorial defense commitments very seriously.

In the 1990s, most European states redefined their take on military defense. Between 1989 and 2013, most European militaries became small all-volunteer forces well suited for multinational expeditionary operations with token troop contributions. Division and brigade structures were axed. Long-range fires, electronic warfare, ground-based air defense, main battle tanks, and multiple-launch rocket systems were scrapped. Military crisis management, civil-military cooperation, and counterinsurgency warfare replaced mechanized maneuver warfare in military doctrines. In short, Western militaries—particularly in Europe—shrank.<br>There was one exception: Finland. It never dropped the ball on territorial defense. Today, this is paying dividends. In the field of defense, there are no quick fixes. Lost military capability cannot be replaced quickly. This is at the heart of the European military malaise. There is no need for so-called external tripwire forces when you have your house in order. Trying to outsource one’s defense-related costs to others (for example to the United States) is no way to proceed when dealing with questions of national security and survival.

It lost a significant amount of military capacity for territorial defense, particularly in the land domain. But still, Sweden maintained significant maritime and air warfare capabilities throughout the period. And after 2014, Sweden has refocused on the defense of its own territory and adjacent areas. In addition, military procurement has been boosted. And the outlook for future increases of the Swedish defense budget looks positive. In addition, Finland and Sweden are engaged in bilateral and multilateral defense cooperation arrangements. Maintaining and developing credible territorial defense capabilities does not restrict possibilities for international cooperation.<br>In fact, Finland and Sweden have expanded their respective defense cooperation agendas—with each other bilaterally—and with others. The United States is an important actor in this regard, as is NATO. But defense cooperation cannot substitute for sufficient national military capabilities.

 began a not-so-covert military intervention in Ukraine, stoking a conflict that has killed 13,000. In the West, Moscow’s actions were roundly condemned; for the Kremlin, they surely look different. Five years later it is worth asking: Has President Vladimir Putin’s gamble in Ukraine paid off and, if so, for whom? The answer is of paramount importance as it can illuminate Russian leaders’ decisions on future interventions—whether to pursue them, where and how.<br>To answer the question, this article will attempt to take stock of some key costs and benefits generated by Russia’s intervention in Ukraine at the following levels: (I) for the Russian state, measured by the impact on vital national interests as seen by Russia’s leadership; (II) for Putin personally; (III) for Russia’s ruling elite; (IV) for the Russian economy; and (V) for the Russian public.<br>On balance, it is this author’s view that the intervention advanced one vital national interest for Russia, as seen from the Kremlin—preventing the growing proximity of a hostile military alliance—while doing damage to several others, primarily involving development of the economy and constructive relations with both post-Soviet neighbors and key Western countries. If Putin’s hope was that the costs imposed by the West on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine would be as fleeting as the costs imposed after Russia’s intervention in Georgia in 2008, then he clearly erred in his calculations. These costs have been manageable so far, but there is a chance they can eventually become prohibitive—not only due to the cumulative impact of ever-expanding Western sanctions in the longer term, but because of Russia’s lackluster economic growth model.<br>As I argued in my recent analysis of the drivers behind Russia’s interventions during Putin’s rule, the Kremlin’s use of force in Ukraine was meant to defend what Russia’s ruling elite see as their country’s vital interest in preventing the expansion of hostile alliances on its borders. The intervention undoubtedly delayed whatever plans the U.S. and some of its NATO allies may have had to keep a promise made to Ukraine and Georgia in April 2008, in the final communique of NATO’s summit in Bucharest, that both 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    “will become members of NATO.”1 There is, of course, no guarantee that the alliance will not eventually grant Kiev (and Tbilisi) membership sometime in the future, but, on the current trajectory, the likelihood of such a development in the next decade is rather low, in my view. It is also my view that this kind of time horizon is sufficient for Vladimir Putin’s strategic planning purposes.
While defending Russia’s interest in keeping NATO at arm’s length, however, the ongoing intervention in Ukraine has had a negative impact on several of Russia’s other vital interests (see Table 1). For one thing, at least in the near to medium future, Moscow’s actions have made any hopes of anchoring Ukraine to Russia futile; this runs counter to Russia’s interest in being surrounded by friendly states among which it can play leading role and in cooperation with which it can thrive. Putin may be harboring hopes that a regime change in Kiev—whether through presidential elections March 31 or some other means—will bring to power someone friendlier to Moscow than Petro Poroshenko. But with or without Poroshenko it is difficult to imagine that ordinary Ukrainians will warm up to the idea of pursuing integration with Russia, at least as long as the conflict in eastern Ukraine continues. None of the top three contenders in Ukraine’s current presidential race is running on mending ties with Russia. And, as of February 2019, only 23 percent of Ukrainians wanted their country to enter the Russian-led Customs Union, while 51 percent wanted it in the EU, even without the separatist regions in Donbass, according to Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, or KIIS. (Most polls conducted since Spring 2014 have not included respondents in Donbass and Crimea.)

 Moreover, the share of Ukrainians who support NATO membership for their country went from 13 percent in 2012 to 41.6 percent in 2018, according to the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiative Foundation.2<br>Table 1<br>Russia’s vital national interests affected by the intervention in Ukraine<br>Impact<br>Ensure Russian allies' survival and their active cooperation with Russia; ensure Russia is surrounded by friendly states among which Russia can play leading role and in cooperation with which it can thrive;<br>Formidable lasting negative impact on efforts to anchor Ukraine.<br>Prevent emergence and/or expansion of individual hostile powers and/or hostile alliances on or near Russian borders;<br>Significant positive impact.<br>Establish and maintain productive relations, consistent with Russian national interests, with the U.S., China and core EU members;<br>Significant lasting negative impact on relations with the U.S. and EU; somewhat positive impact on relations with China.<br>Ensure the viability and stability of major markets for major flows of Russian exports and imports;<br>Significant lasting negative impact due to Western sanctions.<br>Ensure steady development and diversification of the Russian economy and its integration into the global economy.<br>Significant lasting negative impact due to Western sanctions.<br>In addition to making many Ukrainians averse to Russian-led integration projects, the intervention also undermined Russia’s interest in maintaining constructive relations with the U.S. and key EU members. These relationships are now often described as Cold War 2.0 and it remains unclear whether or when they might become normal without a change of behavior by Russia in eastern Ukraine. In the meantime, NATO members are busy beefing up the alliance’s eastern flank, which obviously creates headaches for Russia’s military strategists, while also imposing rounds of sanctions on Russia over Ukraine. These sanctions, whose costs will be discussed below, cannot but damage another vital national interest of Russia’s: ensuring the viability and stability of major markets for Russian imports and exports. Since the intervention, Western countries have significantly curtailed Russia’s ability to legally import some of the technologies critical for the development of its defense electronics, shale fracking and other segments of the economy. Russia’s overall trade with the U.S. and EU countries has suffered too, though this decline probably had more to do with the petering out of Russian economic growth rather than with sanctions per se. (See Table 2 for Russia’s trade with select countries and groups of countries, as estimated by its customs service. Also, see Table 3 in Appendix for a more detailed ranking.)<br>Table 2<br>Countries<br>Volume of trade in billions of USD, 2013<br>Volume of trade in billions of USD, 2018<br>Change in volume of trade in 2013-2018<br>China<br>88.8<br>108.28<br>22%<br>Netherlands<br>75.96<br>47.16<br>-38%<br>Germany<br>74.94<br>59.61<br>-20%<br>Italy<br>53.87<br>26.99<br>-50%<br>Belarus<br>34.19<br>34<br>-1%<br>Japan<br>33.23<br>21.27<br>-36%<br>Turkey<br>32.75<br>25.56<br>-22%<br>Poland<br>27.91<br>21.68<br>-22%<br>United States<br>27.64<br>25.02<br>-9%<br>Groups of Countries<br>Volume of trade in billions of USD, 2013<br>Volume of trade in billions of USD, 2018<br>Change in volume of trade in 2013-2018<br>EU<br>417.66<br>294.17<br>-30%<br>APEC<br>208.47<br>213.26<br>2%<br>CIS<br>112.51<br>80.82<br>-28%<br>It is quite difficult to separate the impact of the intervention from other factors in explaining changes in Putin’s popularity and public trust.

 after Russia annexed the peninsula: As demonstrated in Chart 1, which reflects findings by Russia’s leading private pollster, the Levada Center, Putin’s popularity shot up after he became the first Russian leader since Joseph Stalin to expand the country’s territory—making Crimea’s 27,000 square kilometers and 2.25 million people part of the Russian Federation. (Though, as with the aforementioned decline in Russia’s foreign trade with certain countries, one should always be careful to separate correlation from causation and to avoid the “post hoc, ergo propter hoc” fallacy.)<br>Chart 1<br>In contrast, it is more difficult to gauge, first, what impact the subsequent Western sanctions had on the economy and, second, how that impact may have factored into the subsequent decline in Putin’s approval rating. After all, as detailed below, the Russian economy would have most probably shrunk somewhat even without sanctions due, in part, to the drop in oil prices, which remain a key driver of Russia’s economic output. We should also factor in the impact of unpopular measures recently enacted by Putin, such as approving hikes in the pension age and value-added tax, as well as hoarding money in the country’s rainy-day fund even as Russians’ real incomes continued to decline. What is clear is that Putin cannot ignore the fact that Russians’ confidence in him reached a record low this year, falling under 33 percent, according to the state-owned Russian Public Opinion Research Center, or VCIOM (see Chart 2, and compare Putin’s numbers with the 40 percent of Turks who trust in their own authoritarian ruler, Recep Erdoğan). The consensus among Kremlinologists inside and outside Russia is that Putin will probably remain in charge until the end of his fourth term in 2024. However, for Putin to either rule beyond then or install a successor, per the ruling elite’s interest in regime survival, he needs, at the very least, to prevent a further decline of popular trust in him.<br>Chart 2<br>It goes without saying that much of Russia’s ruling elite—who have for years chosen to school their children, buy real estate and park money in Western countries—were not exactly happy with the way Russia’s relations with the U.S. and EU deteriorated in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. Many of them suffered from the broad restrictive measures the West imposed on Russia, while some also had

 of being subjected to personal sanctions. That was the case, for instance, with Gennady Timchenko and the Rotenberg brothers, who had been close friends of Putin’s for decades and then became billionaires after he became president, in part because of the lucrative state contracts and other perks they enjoyed.<br>However, if we look to see whether these people’s fortunes have shrunk since the first sanctions were imposed in late March 2014, we find little change overall. The collective fortune of Russia’s richest 200 people, as estimated by Forbes magazine, went from $488 billion in 2013 to $483 billion in 2018, declining by a mere 1 percent—hardly a dramatic loss, even if Western sanctions were entirely to blame, without factoring in traditional determinants of Russia’s economic performance such as world energy prices.<br>Moreover, if we look at some of the men Putin

 from his predecessor, they actually saw their fortunes increase despite being subjected to individual sanctions. That was the case with Timchenko, whose fortune grew by 13 percent from $14.1 billion in 2013 to $16 billion in 2018, according to Forbes; the combined fortunes of the Rotenberg brothers and their children grew too, by 12 percent from $4.7 billion in 2013 to $5.3 billion. Given these hefty increases, it should be no wonder these men are not complaining about such consequences of sanctions as the inability to continue owning personal jets.<br>If we were to look at an even broader tier of Russia’s rich, they collectively did well as well.  The  number of millionaires in Russia and their total wealth grew by 20 percent from 2015 to 2016, according to Grigory Yavlinsky’s latest book, “The Putin System,” meant to issue a damning verdict on the president’s rule. More recently, the number of Russian nationals with $30 million or more to their names grew by 7 percent in 2018 compared to 2017, according to Knight Frank’s latest Wealth Report. Of course, many of those people could have been even richer had there been no intervention and, therefore, no sanctions. However, they also know that complaining publicly about the loss of potential profits because of the country’s foreign policy is not such a good idea in a country where even complaints about domestic policies may cost you billions, and years in jail, as was the case with Mikhail Khodorkovsky. One should also bear in mind that, according to an IMF estimate, the Russian state accounts for more than one-third of Russia’s GDP3 and most, if not all, CEOs of Russia’s leading state companies are Putin’s personal friends and/or staunch loyalists, such as Rosneft’s Igor Sechin, Gazprom’s Alexei Miller and Rotec’s Sergei Chemezov who remain unwavering in their support for Putin, intervention and sanctions or not.<br>Ukraine-related sanctions have done considerable damage to the Russian economy, although measuring that damage with any precision is difficult for several reasons. First, as stated above, it is hard to separate the sanctions’ impact from that of other factors, such as fluctuating world energy prices.4 Second, it may be even more difficult to separate the impact of Ukraine-related sanctions from the impact of other punitive measures against Russia—over its intervention in Syria, alleged meddling in the U.S. elections and other conduct. However, these difficulties have not stopped a number of prominent experts on the Russian economy from offering their educated guesses about how much Western sanctions may have cost Russia. Former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin estimated in 2017 and 2018 that the Russian economy would have annually grown by about half a percentage point more in recent years in the absence of sanctions. It follows from Kudrin’s estimate that Russia’s 2017 GDP would have been 460 billion rubles larger (or $7.9 billion at the average rate for the end of 2017) than its 92 trillion-ruble total that year. Others estimated the damage to be higher. For instance, Bloomberg experts calculated in 2018 that the Russian economy was 10 percent smaller than it would have been without sanctions. An earlier estimate by Russian economists said Russia was losing about 1.5 percent of economic output every year.<br>While it is difficult to nail down exactly how much the West’s Ukraine-related sanctions have cost the Russian economy, Moscow’s Ministry of Economic Development has produced some estimates broken down by country or group of countries. A presentation posted on its website in February 2019 claims that, as of the end of 2018, all sorts of

    “restrictive measures”
    <span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">Content</span>
</mark>
 by other countries—including not just sanctions but various tariffs, quotas, special licensing and others—have cost Russia $6.3 billion.5 (Over how many years is unclear.) The most damage has been caused by the EU, which displaced Russia as Ukraine’s largest trading partner after the 2014 revolution: Its various measures have cost Russia $2.4 billion. The second-most damage, according to the ministry, has been caused by the U.S. at nearly $1.2 billion; of this, some $760 million were losses in potential sales of Russian guns and ammunition on the U.S. domestic market. (While Russia ranked first among the world’s largest arms exporters in 2013, with $7.9 billion worth of arms transferred that year, it fell to second place in 2018, with $6.4 billion worth of arms exported, or a 19-percent decline.) The Economic Development Ministry identified Ukraine as the country to do the third-most damage to Russia through its restrictions and sanctions—$775 million. In addition to these measures, Ukraine is also suing Russia for more than $160 million in damages over losses incurred by Ukrainian companies after the annexation of Crimea.<br>It is easier to estimate how much annexing Crimea has cost Russia’s federal budget in terms of subsidies.6 According to renowned Russian economist Sergei Aleksashenko, federal subsidies to Crimea will total 700 billion rubles ($10.6 billion) for 2014-2019. That would average out to about 116 billion rubles a year, which is significant given that the overall volume of subsidies in 2018 was reportedly a record-setting 1 trillion rubles, but could not bankrupt the federal budget, which ran a surplus of nearly 2.8 trillion rubles that year. (In addition to subsidies, state-owned companies invested another 600 billion rubles, or about $9.1 billion, into Crimea in 2014-2019, according to Aleksashenko.)<br>It should also be noted, of course, that some of the counter-sanctions introduced by Russia in response to the West’s punitive measures did foster growth in certain sectors of the Russian economy. For instance, Russia’s ban on many Western food products encouraged local agricultural production, which grew even as the economy tanked; overall, however, agriculture’s share in GDP was too tiny (2.4-5 percent) to make a tangible impact on economic growth. In fact, the growth of Russia’s agricultural sector has contributed around 0.1 percentage points to overall GDP growth, according to Nordea Bank analyst Tatyana Yevdokimova. The Russian economy grew by 0.7 percent in 2014, declined by 2.8 percent in 2015, declined by 0.2 percent in 2016, grew by 1.5 percent in 2017 and grew by 1.6 percent in 2018, according to the World Bank. Moreover, the bank projects that the Russian economy will grow by 1.5 percent in 2019 and another 1.8 percent in 2020, while Moody's Investor Service has raised Russia's rating to investment grade.<br>If anything, this growth pattern shows that, while the economic costs of the intervention have been tangible, they have not caused an economic meltdown in Russia. This could change, however, if the U.S. Congress imposes more restrictive measures and, more broadly, if the impact of even some existing sanctions is so long-term that it has yet to be fully felt, as predicted by Igor Dmitriev, the Harvard Business School-educated chief executive of Russia's sovereign investment fund.<br>While Russia has largely denied having an unsanctioned military presence in Ukraine, one estimate from a reputable source has placed the number of Russian nationals killed in the fighting higher than one-tenth of total fatalities in the five-year war. The U.N. estimated in February 2019 that the conflict in eastern Ukraine had killed 13,000 people and wounded another 30,000; of those killed 3,300 were civilians, 4,000 were Ukrainian soldiers and 5,500 separatist fighters. How many of the latter were Russian nationals is difficult to estimate. An established Russian NGO called Soldiers’ Mothers has estimated that some 1,500 Russian nationals died in eastern Ukraine in 2014-2017. A more recent estimate by the former prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Alexander Borodai, is that several citizens of Russia get killed in action every week in Donbass. Rather than put an end to Russia’s involvement in the conflict, which has cost so many lives on all sides, the Russian authorities have been busy trying to suppress news of casualties among Russian nationals in Donbass and, so far, public discontent with it is relatively muted—nowhere close to what it was during the first Chechen war in 1992-1994, when public outrage helped nudge Moscow toward a peace deal.<br>Ordinary Russians have also suffered economically, though how much of that suffering can be attributed to the Ukraine conflict and consequent sanctions is difficult to tell; either way, it does not seem to have undercut broad support for Moscow’s foreign interventions. While Russia’s economy and its richest citizens have weathered the sanctions-induced storms so far, the average standard of living has declined. Russians’ real incomes fell by 0.7 percent in 2014, 3.2 percent in 2015, 5.8 percent in 2016, 1.2 percent in 2016 and 0.8 percent in January-November 2018, according to Svetlana Misikhina, a senior scholar at the Moscow-based Higher School of Economics. At the same time, while state-sponsored polls should obviously be treated with pinch of salt, some of them do show that ordinary Russians do not feel particularly affected by the Western sanctions imposed on their country over its interventions and alleged meddling. A poll by Russia’s respected private pollster, the Levada Center, last year showed that 78 percent of Russians felt they and their families had not encountered major problems because of Western sanctions, and 68 percent of Russians were

 against their country. One should also bear in mind that public servants and employees of state-owned companies have reportedly come to account for more than half of Russia’s middle class, and these people are less likely to publicly challenge the state and its policies, in part because they are dependent on the state for their livelihood.

 At this stage, it may also be too soon to tell whether Russia’s intervention in Ukraine has resulted in a net loss or gain for the successor to the late USSR. On one hand, in terms of national interests, the ongoing intervention has advanced what the Kremlin sees as Russia’s vital interest in preventing the emergence or expansion of hostile alliances on Russian borders by sending a strong signal to Kiev, Brussels and Washington that admitting Ukraine into NATO remains one of

 to his boss, Condoleezza Rice, shortly before Russia’s intervention in Georgia. On the other hand, that may have been the only significant geopolitical benefit that Russia derived from its use of force in Ukraine. The intervention did considerable damage to other key Russian interests: ensuring Russia can thrive, surrounded by friendly neighbors; maintaining productive relations with the United States and core European Union members; and ensuring the viability and stability of major markets for Russian exports and imports. It is debatable whether advancing these interests should have taken priority over preventing NATO expansion when Putin and his narrow circle debated in February 2014 whether to intervene in Ukraine. But it is clear that the surge in Putin’s popularity in the wake of annexation is over, and the recent decline in Russians’ confidence in their leader should worry both Putin and his key allies in the ruling elite, even if some of them have seen their fortunes increase since the intervention began. Moreover, the costs for Russia of continued alienation from the West—due to this intervention and other points of discontent—are growing and may eventually become unaffordable unless one or both of two things happen: either Russia finds a new economic model that will let its economy become competitive and grow at least as fast as the world’s as a whole—all while semi-isolated from the West—or Moscow reaches a compromise on issues of major disagreement, including the Ukraine conflict.<br>When Russia launched its intervention in Ukraine, some inside and outside the country wagered that the costs imposed by the West would be as fleeting as after Russia's intervention in Georgia. If Putin made such a calculation too when sending in troops, he’s lost that bet.<br>Table 3<br>2013<br>2013<br>2018<br>2018<br>Russia’s Top 10 trading partners in 2013<br>Billions, USD<br>% in overall volume of trade<br>Russia’s Top 10 trading partners in 2018<br>Billions, USD<br>% in overall volume of trade<br>1<br>China<br>88.80<br>10.5<br>1<br>China<br>108.28<br>15.7<br>2<br>Netherlands<br>75.96<br>9<br>2<br>Germany<br>59.61<br>8.7<br>3<br>Germany<br>74.94<br>8.9<br>3<br>Netherlands<br>47.16<br>6.9<br>4<br>Italy<br>53.87<br>6.4<br>4<br>Belarus<br>34.00<br>4.9<br>5<br>Ukraine<br>39.60<br>4.7<br>5<br>Italy<br>26.99<br>3.9<br>6<br>Belarus<br>34.19<br>4.1<br>6<br>Turkey<br>25.56<br>3.7<br>7<br>Japan<br>33.23<br>3.9<br>7<br>United States<br>25.02<br>3.6<br>8<br>Turkey<br>32.75<br>3.9<br>8<br>Korea, Republic<br>24.84<br>3.6<br>9<br>Poland<br>27.91<br>3.3<br>9<br>Poland<br>21.68<br>3.2<br>10<br>United States<br>27.64<br>3.3<br>10<br>Japan<br>21.27<br>3.1<br>2013<br>2013<br>2018<br>2018<br>Groups of countries as top trading partners, 2013<br>Billion, USD<br>% in overall volume of trade<br>Groups of countries as top trading partners, 2018<br>Billion, USD<br>% in overall volume of trade<br>1<br>EU<br>417.659<br>49.6<br>1<br>EU<br>294.17<br>42.7<br>2<br>APEC<br>208.4663<br>24.8<br>2<br>APEC<br>213.26<br>31<br>3<br>CIS<br>112.509<br>13.4<br>3<br>CIS<br>80.82<br>11.7<br>4<br>EURASEC<br>60.6083<br>7.2<br>4<br>EAEU<br>56.07<br>8.1<br>Simon Saradzhyan is the founding director of the Russia Matters Project at Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.<br>Photo by Anton Holoborodko shared under a CC BY-SA 3.0 license.<br>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">One of the few things America’s Joe Biden and Russia’s Vladimir Putin had agreed upon prior to their first summit almost half a year ago was that they would not hold a joint press conference after their June 16 huddle at an 18th century villa in Geneva. The two presidents’ decision to talk to press separately came as no surprise, given how many major issues they publicly disagreed on at the time. Moreover, while Biden reportedly acted to delay a missile test that could have raised tensions with Russia prior to the summit, the U.S. president asserted publicly that he did not view the meeting as an end in itself: Whatever he and his Russian counterpart agreed on during the four-hour sit-down had to be implemented if U.S.-Russian relations were to move away from hyper-tension during his presidency,

.<br>As Biden’s self-imposed deadline of Dec. 16 nears, I have decided to comb through open sources to review the two leaders’ agreements and offer a mostly subjective assessment of their implementation, if only to try to gauge whether or not Biden will give up on Putin (and vice versa), as most of his recent predecessors eventually did. The outcome of my research is not unequivocal (see table below). An optimist would interpret the results as encouraging enough to continue the U.S.-Russian summitry in hopes of first stabilizing the relationship and then, perhaps, attaining tangible positive results on issues of mutual interest, such as stabilizing Afghanistan and preventing a resurgence of jihadist terrorism. A pessimist, in contrast, would see a lining that is not silver enough to move beyond deconfliction.<br>Agreements or understandings reached by Biden and Putin on June 16, 2021<br>Implementation as of Nov. 29, 2021<br>1.

<br>While the U.S. has expressed willingness to join the so-called Normandy Format—an effort by Russia, France, Germany and Ukraine to resolve the Ukraine conflict, including by advancing implementation of the so-called Minsk-2 agreement—it has not, and the four participating countries’ leaders have not met since 2019. It has also been a while since the foreign ministers of the quartet have met—a setback that France, Germany and Ukraine blame on Russia’s intransigence. Moreover, it is far from clear whether the conflict will remain frozen and, if so, for how long, given the recent escalation of tensions, which the West and Ukraine believe could culminate in a Russian invasion.<br>5.

 The resolution was passed unanimously with both U.S. and Russia supporting it, but Moscow got criticized by Western media and international NGOs for refusing to authorize additional humanitarian corridors, which is something the U.S. had advocated.<br>As the table above demonstrates, Biden and Putin reportedly agreed to implement six items during their June 16 summit: (1) resumption of cyber security talks; (2) resumption of strategic stability talks; (3) return of ambassadors; (4) continuation of efforts to resolve the Ukraine conflict on the basis of the Minsk agreements; (5)

 between the presidents.)<br>I should note that, in addition to the items listed above, Biden and Putin also discussed Iran’s nuclear program and the Arctic; however, neither leader specified in his post-summit press conference whether they had agreed on any deliverables, so I chose not to include these two items in the table. Nor have I included the potential exchange of prisoners between the U.S. and Russia, for the same reason. While the two leaders did reportedly agree at the summit that their governments would explore the possibility of such an exchange, they are not known to have agreed on anything concrete on the issue, which remains deadlocked. While U.S. diplomats continue to call for the release of Americans held in Russian prisons, and Russian diplomats do the same for their compatriots in U.S. jails, the sides disagree on what would constitute an adequate exchange. The Russian side reportedly wants to exchange ex-U.S. Marine Paul Whelan for arms dealer Viktor Bout and/or drug smuggler Konstantin Yaroshenko, while the U.S. reportedly wants Russia to return Whelan in exchange for a Russian hacker and a Russian businessman.<br>If Biden does give the outcome of the June 16 summit a passing grade and agrees to another bilateral summit, the two leaders could, perhaps, pick some of the lower-hanging fruit. This could include suspending, if not reversing, the aforementioned plans to compel more of each other’s diplomats to leave next year, as well as exchanging prisoners. Further down the road, other elements of a win-win agenda could include preventing Afghanistan’s slide into a failed state, combined with preventing the reappearance of bases of international terrorist networks there and elsewhere in Central Asia, as well as in the Middle East. In addition, Biden and Putin could fairly easily agree on further coordination of U.S. and Russian efforts within the framework of the P5+1 to bring Iran into compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, especially if reports of Iran’s push toward enrichment of uranium to weapons grade are true.<br>That said, there are still two weeks left before Biden’s self-imposed deadline for assessing implementation of the summit’s agreements and there are quite a few things that could go wrong between now and then. Some of them could derail attempts at stabilizing the bilateral relationship for long, if not for good. For instance, the U.S. may conclude that the Havana Syndrome is not psychogenic but induced by external sources and Russia is to blame, in spite of its strong denials. Alternatively, Russia could initiate force against Ukraine per multiple predictions made by Ukrainian and Western officials, even though I personally believe such a move is unlikely until Putin exhausts diplomatic options with Biden. Moreover, a major disruption in bilateral interaction could occur as a result of accidents or deliberate steps taken by external players acting beyond both leaders’ control.  For instance, opportunistic factions concerned about the negative impact of a normalized U.S.-Russian relationship on their fortunes could try to provoke the resumption of fighting in eastern Ukraine. If no black swans appear, however, then, perhaps, we will continue to see an incremental stabilization of the relationship between the two nuclear superpowers—able to destroy each other and the rest of humanity—per Biden’s wish that this relationship be

Stent, arguably the doyen of America’s diminishing cadre of scholar-practitioners who understand both Russia and the U.S. national security decision-making process, is well positioned to help clear up the confusion.<br>

 provide anyone in government working to develop policy options vis-a-vis Russia with a clear and compelling roadmap for understanding and anticipating Kremlin moves.

; and Russia will increasingly step in to frustrate Western efforts to promote change to existing global norms that privilege sovereignty and stability. The last two pillars focus on concrete outcomes: to achieve its interests, Russia believes it must:  promote fractures in the Euro-Atlantic community, particularly amplifying transatlantic tensions that have accelerated since the election of Donald Trump; and push for ongoing revisions and modifications to the post-Cold War international order.<br>Viewed with these pillars in mind, the limited Russian interventions in Syria and Venezuela come into greater clarity. At relatively low cost, Moscow has challenged the U.S. and exposed the gap between Washington’s rhetoric and reality, while enhancing Putin’s image as a decisive leader who defends Russian partners. As Stent notes, one result of the Russian intervention in Syria has been to restore Russia’s position as an alternative arbiter to the United States for Middle Eastern conflicts.<br>Of course, as Stent makes clear, Putin is not pursuing this course of action simply for Cold War nostalgia. His long-term aim is to ensure that other key power centers in the world—China, Europe, even ultimately the United States—have a vested interest in supporting and sustaining Russia’s role as one of the great powers. One lesson Putin has learned from the collapse of the USSR appears to be the importance of connecting geopolitical imperatives with economic and political benefits; so Putin expects Russian intervention today to pay dividends for the Kremlin, whether in terms of contracts or investments. Moscow has reaped some of the benefits of its activism in the Middle East—whether forging a new energy partnership with Turkey, obtaining lucrative investments from Saudi Arabia and Qatar, or ensuring that Israel does not join Western sanctions on Russia.<br>As an analyst,

 has not allowed Moscow to completely turn its back on the West. Yet Stent’s narrative shows a Putin team that, despite its troubles, needs to be recognized for how it has largely successfully exploited U.S. setbacks and failures--plus deftly used a much more limited set of resources than either the United States or even what the USSR enjoyed—to resurrect Russia as a global player.<br>This work is a piece of analysis, not advocacy; it does not describe the Russia that U.S. policymakers might want but the Russia that is. For the same reasons that “Putin’s World” is such a compelling read, however, its conclusions are likely to be papered over by American politicians who do not want to confront realities. Putin is not depicted in these pages as a Dr.-Evil-style villain bent on global domination, and Stent makes it clear that good analysis requires understanding the world from the Kremlin’s point of view. The book’s measured, analytic tone may expose it to charges that it is too sympathetic to or apologetic for the Kremlin. Such claims would be amplified by the fact that Stent’s work provides little analytic justification for some of the deeply held hopes of parts of the U.S. policy establishment: that Russia is near collapse; that Russia’s

 those relationships and institutions that the U.S. relies upon in maintaining the current global system. In other words, she calls for a long-term approach that can simultaneously deter and contain but also engage with Russia. Indeed, Stent’s recommendations, in my opinion, parallel the approach to Russia exemplified by Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emmanuel Macron—pressuring Russia to stop its malign activity and fortifying Western defenses, but ring-fencing beneficial areas of cooperation (like arms control or counterterrorism) and, most critically, keeping channels of communication between Moscow and the West open.<br>Can the U.S. national security system accommodate her recommendations?

 Developments over the last two years, however, do not inspire confidence. Congress has passed and continues to contemplate blanket sanctions legislation that strips much of the flexibility the executive branch would need to have greater agility in coping with Russia, while the Trump administration’s failure to adequately staff the government means that, in many key posts, responsible persons with the authority and mandate to develop and execute policy are absent. What is most concerning is that the U.S. seems to be abdicating any proactivity when it comes to Russia policy until after the Trump and Putin tenures in office have ended. If that is the case, then advantage and initiative will continue to rest with Moscow.

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Xi Jinping’s consolidation of power in China have raised fears of a comparable military conflict in the Taiwan Strait. Moscow has annexed, on paper, parts of eastern Ukraine that it sees as its traditional territory and regards NATO as a hostile force. China, meanwhile, sees Taiwan as a local government and the Taiwan Strait as an internal sea. Such claims of sovereignty and maritime rights challenge international norms embraced by the West and its allies, as well as some of their interests, thus creating contestation beyond the borders of the regions in question.<br>While the fighting in Ukraine is on land, and thus very different from the maritime battlefield that would surround Taiwan, there are still many things my island nation can learn from Ukraine's defensive operations. One similarity in particular is that Taiwan, like Ukraine, is a relatively weak power facing the threat of a much larger one—and that asymmetry lies at the heart of many of the lessons outlined below, including that a nation’s security cannot rely solely on promises of peace and that continuity of government operations is vital.<br>In some key respects, Taiwan finds itself in a more advantageous position than Ukraine. It is geographically separated from its adversary by the strait and its GDP in 2021 was nearly four times Ukraine’s by one measure,1 giving Taiwan the financial leeway to bolster its defenses in advance.<br>Before considering lessons for Taiwan, it is important to note that China has also learned from the Russian-Ukrainian war, most notably by improving its psychological warfare capabilities, which have increasingly targeted Taiwan, and enlarging its nuclear arsenal (a process that began before the current war). Nuclear weapons afford Beijing a “political denial” capability, in addition to its conventional military anti-access/area-denial capabilities, to deter other countries from assisting Taiwan. The fact that Moscow's nuclear arsenal has kept the West from sending troops into Ukraine has likely reaffirmed China’s drive to accelerate the build-up of its nuclear arsenal and rocket forces.<br>Below I have listed eight possible lessons for Taiwan from the Ukraine war.<br>1. National security cannot rely solely on promises of peace, even in writing. While dialogue may help reduce misunderstandings, it is useless against a determined aggressor. The so-called Budapest Memorandum of 1994, which provided assurances meant to safeguard Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, did not prevent Moscow from annexing Crimea 20 years later or starting a full-blown war early last year. Likewise, the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and its protocols did not keep the Nazis from invading the Soviet Union in June 1941.<br>2. Continuity of government operations both demonstrates and bolsters a people’s determination and will to resist a military onslaught. Western countries originally thought Ukraine would quickly fall. However, the courage of President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian people succeeded in resisting the Russian army and made the European countries understand that Ukraine was the first front of defense of democracy and succeeded in gaining international support. In practical terms, Zelensky and other senior officials have stayed in Kyiv, kept the trains running, empowered local authorities and volunteers to help those affected by Russian attacks and tried tenaciously to repair damaged infrastructure.<br>3. A military strategy based on sea denial. Ukraine may not have seemed well-prepared before the war—corruption in the defense sector, for example, impacted war preparations—but it was able to resist effectively after the war started. In addition to demonstrating courage and will, the reinstatement of military conscription after 2014 provided the Ukrainian army with sufficient reserve manpower to play a key role in defending the frontlines against the Russian army and attacking Russian rear lines of communication, including by flank attack or circuitous means. Taiwan, with its democratic beliefs, espouses a policy of strategic defense and will never launch a first strike, so its military strategy must be deterrence. It is necessary to ensure counterstrike capability and credibility in order to deter effectively; therefore, lower cost and high survivability of precision-guided weapons systems become the preferred choice and can make good use of Taiwan's geographical characteristics to quickly establish Taiwan's sea denial capability in responding to China's threats.<br>4. Take threat signals seriously and strengthen defenses rapidly.  Beijing has signaled in its &quot;White Paper on Taiwan Policy&quot; and in Xi's speeches that it will never promise to renounce the option of using force against Taiwan; official Communist Party communications likewise make it clear that Xi wants to see the unification of Taiwan with mainland China. These policies are even more explicit than Russia's publicly stated concerns about Ukraine drawing closer to NATO  and statements, in its military doctrine and elsewhere, about Moscow’s right to protect its citizens beyond its borders. Faced with such a clear signal of threat, Taiwan must quickly increase its defense budget to strengthen its war readiness, in my view: By raising spending to 3% of GDP, we can build sufficient military capabilities and readiness.<br>5. Redesign investment strategies to account for military asymmetry. By some estimates, China spends 17 times more on its military than Taiwan, so Taiwan needs investments that boost its chances of defending itself successfully. Military strategy is like a symphony that must combine very different capabilities. Aside from Stinger and Javelin missiles, the war in Ukraine has highlighted the value of long-range defensive weapons such as M777 howitzer and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System（HIMARS）. The same would apply in the Taiwan Strait. Relying only on small, short-range weapons systems would make the sea an enemy highway. Taiwan needs modern military technology and precision-guided munitions that favor the defender and would allow Taiwan’s smaller force to destroy the enemy's amphibious fleet and prevent it from landing. This will be helped along by Taiwan's special five-year budget of $8.5 billion to enhance air and sea missile capabilities. The main force, in my view, should be ground-based anti-ship and air-defense missiles, uncrewed vehicle systems and counter-strike missiles that help keep the enemy at bay. (This is also good value for money: For example, it may take 24 months to construct a frigate but only three and a half days for Taiwan to build an anti-ship missile; Ukraine's sinking of the Russian cruiser Moskva with two anti-ship missiles serves as a good example of the effectiveness of such asymmetry.) The challenge is that Taiwan must also contend with coercive gray-zone campaigns that may become China’s

: quasi-military operations using warplanes and warships close to Taiwan's airspace and waters to create psychological pressure. This makes it necessary to also invest in platforms such as fighter planes and warships.<br>6. Design an effective communications strategy. Ukraine's experience in international communications is also valuable. Taiwan must make the international community understand that Taiwan does not see China as an enemy, but that China sees democracy as an enemy. Taiwan is democratic and China is authoritarian. This is a competition of systems. The issue of the Taiwan Strait is not an issue of unification versus independence. Taiwan’s position should be cast as anti-communist, not anti-China. This, in my view, will help counter Beijing's propaganda about the &quot;One China Principle&quot; because in the PRC constitution the Chinese Communist Party is the only legal ruling party of China, which means that Beijing's assertion of

 equals one-party rule. Breaking Beijing’s strategic narrative could spare Taiwan a lot of trouble and obstacles and gain more international support.<br>7. Strengthen defensive resilience. Taiwan’s government has announced the resumption of conscription, replacing four-month training with one-year military service, which will help improve Taiwan's defensive resilience, in my view. According to a Taiwanese poll released in August, 65.5% of respondents agreed that year-long compulsory military service should be reinstated. Conscription will provide more manpower to destroy the small number of enemy troops (amphibious or airborne) that do come ashore and, at the same time, instill a sense of

</mark>
 Ukraine has also been relying on conscription as part of its attempts to repel the Russian invasion.<br>8. Conduct joint training with allied partners but prepare for the worst-case scenario. Pre-war joint exercises involving U.S., NATO and Ukrainian forces, as well as the emergency training during wartime, have been plentiful and seemingly effective. The West’s sharing of real-time intelligence with Ukraine has, meanwhile, greatly contributed to Kyiv’s ability to effectively combat the invading Russian forces. Similar assistance from allies would likewise contribute to Taiwan’s defense. Despite Washington's efforts to provide various kinds of assistance to Taiwan, including military exchange, there are still many obstacles, not least due to the lack of formal diplomatic relations. For Taiwan, this is full of uncertainty—I personally position  international politics as an art—and that is why Taiwan must still prepare for the worst-case scenario and the prospect of fighting alone.<br>Since the Battle of Marathon during the first Persian invasion of Greece, the history of war is replete with cases of small armies defeating large enemies, and Ukraine offers Taiwan strategic inspiration in terms of systematic political-military thinking. Taiwan is already strengthening various defense preparations, including continuous government operations, civil defense, critical infrastructure protection and strategic material reserves. The lessons of Ukraine's defensive war have shortened the learning curve for Taiwan and will be a good reference. Taiwan understands that it will never become a

For all the surprise gains made by the Ukrainian resistance, one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory remains in Russian hands. The good news for the Ukrainians is that recent momentum is with their side; Ukraine’s armed forces have now reclaimed about 55 percent of the territory Russia had occupied earlier in the war.<br>Next, the casualties. As we have said here before, reporting on casualties of this war has been difficult. The data below breaks things down in terms of the varying estimates from different sources, but recently the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff estimated that more than 100,000 Russian troops had been killed or wounded in Ukraine since the war began. The assessment of Ukrainian casualties was nearly as high. It’s a staggering toll — and it continues to grow.<br>As far as civilians are concerned, these numbers are also difficult to assess with accuracy. The United Nations body that tracks civilian casualties in Ukraine has most recently given 6,500 as its figure for the civilian toll, but it only counts a death once a name and other details can be confirmed. Ukrainian officials have estimated that some 40,000 civilians have been killed.<br>Meanwhile, more than 7.8 million people have fled Ukraine as refugees since February, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency; millions more have fled their homes but stayed in the country. It is far and away the largest displacement of people in Europe since World War II. And while a sizable number of refugees have begun to return — for the past few months, traffic at the main border crossing with Poland has been roughly even in both directions — that may change in the coming weeks. This week, the World Health Organization warned that as many as 3 million more Ukrainians will likely leave their homes this winter, as Ukraine’s government begins evacuating areas where it says it cannot guarantee adequate supplies of power and heat.<br>Ten million Ukrainians are now living without power,

Valeriy Zaluzhny, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, said the country had lost about 9,000 troops. In mid-April, U.S. intelligence officials put the number at 5,500 to 11,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed since the invasion. In early November, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, estimated that both sides had about 100,000 soldiers killed or injured.

In its first update on casualties since March, Russia claimed in late September that there had been 5,937 Russian military deaths.

The Czech government’s announcement that Russia was behind an explosion in an arms depot in 2014 and consequent expulsion of 18 diplomats has not only brought new acrimony to Prague’s relationship with Moscow, it also speaks volumes about the Kremlin’s wider thinking.

 linking officers from the GRU, Russian military intelligence, was behind it. As a result, 18 Russian diplomats Prague identified as intelligence officers were given 48 hours to leave the country. Furthermore, the Czech police’s organized crime squad (NCOZ) announced that the two alleged members of the GRU’s now-notorious Unit 29155 were none other than “Alexander Petrov” and “Ruslan Boshirov,” otherwise known as Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga, the men identified as behind the Salisbury novichok case in 2018. It is hard to know which is more surprising: the timing, the scale of the Czech response, or the operation itself. Less than a week earlier, Foreign Minister Tomaš Petřiček had been sacked, in part because he was opposed to buying the Sputnik V vaccine. Instead, Deputy Prime Minister Jan Hamáček had been due to travel to Moscow for discussions on this very topic (though he now claims this was just a smokescreen as the expulsions were prepared). Meanwhile, Rosatom was one of the contenders for the contract to renovate the Dukovany nuclear power station.<br>Indeed, Prague was being touted as a potential venue for a Biden-Putin summit. Suddenly, it is locked in a fierce political battle with the Kremlin. Russia promptly ordered the expulsion of 20 Czech diplomats – a much greater share of its proportionately smaller embassy in Moscow — and there may also be covert retaliation to follow. No wonder not only that some in the Czech Republic are suspicious, presuming that the scandal-dogged Babiš was either trying to introduce a distraction, or else doing a favor for some ally. Certainly this last seems to be the favored line in Moscow. In the government’s Rossiiskaya Gazeta, for example, it was

 that again it was the U.S. and U.K. who wanted this crisis. Babiš is talking about declassifying the intelligence in question, though, and the documentation used for two men to get into the Vrbětice depot, while notionally two officers of the Tajikistan National Guard, are clearly Mishkin and Chepiga — and they used passports in the name of Petrov and Boshirov to enter the Czech Republic. The reason seems to have been connected with the activities of Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev who was negotiating sales to Ukraine, at a time when Kiev’s forces were dangerously low on munitions of many kinds. The speculation in Prague is that the GRU officers placed an explosive device in the munitions bound for Ukraine, meant to explode later. However, in a striking parallel with the Skripal operation — considerable operational skill marred by last-minute clumsiness — it seems to have exploded prematurely in Vrbětice. As for Gebrev, it is worth noting that he appears to have been poisoned by novichok in 2015, again by members of Unit 29155.<br>news Czech Govt Expels 18 Russian Diplomats Over 2014 Blast Read more</div>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">After every U.S. presidential election, hope once again beckons that the new administration will be more successful than its predecessors in improving U.S.-Russian relations. The 2020 elections may finally break that pattern. Assuming that former Vice President Joe Biden takes the oath of office on Inauguration Day 2021, he will take office not as an idealistic or naïve newcomer to foreign affairs, but rather as a veteran with a well-developed sense of priorities and perspectives—and this includes a healthy dose of disillusionment with how President Barack Obama’s efforts to reset relations with Russia beginning in 2009 turned out.<br>This is not particularly good news for the Kremlin, or for Russian President Vladimir Putin, which may explain why Putin held off offering congratulations to the president-elect. When in the Senate, Biden was a consistent critic of Kremlin policy, while also holding up legislation that mattered a great deal to Moscow—such as graduation from the Jackson-Vanik trade sanctions—in order to pressure Russia to be more accommodating to U.S. preferences. A leading advocate for NATO enlargement, the former vice president also was Obama’s point man on Ukraine in supporting Kyiv’s efforts to escape Russia’s geopolitical orbit. A rarity among leading Democratic politicians for his stated support for American oil and gas production, Biden has consistently looked for ways to reduce Russia’s energy influence, especially in Europe.<br>Most of Biden’s selections for senior national security positions in his administration share these views.

 that would inhibit him from making conciliarity gestures toward Moscow for fear of being accused of being a Kremlin agent. He also has consistently demonstrated a pragmatic streak, as evidenced by his role as a voice of moderation and caution within the Obama national security team. Yet a Biden administration is likely to reduce Russia’s freedom of maneuverability on the global stage. For four years, the Kremlin has successfully exploited worries and concerns about the Trump administration’s unpredictability and unreliability to convince key U.S. allies in Europe and Asia to hedge their bets by not foreclosing on their relationships with Moscow.<br>However, Biden is likely to repair much of the damage in U.S.-German relations and attempt to reconstruct the Obama-era Berlin-Washington consensus on dealing with Russia, especially on sanctions and on limiting Russia’s economic influence—including the exploration of a voluntary German pause on the Nord Stream 2 project. If a Biden administration can also lower the temperature in U.S.-China relations, this may reduce some of Beijing’s interests in supporting Moscow, especially if Biden can repair some of the damage caused by Donald Trump’s màoyì zhàn (trade war).<br>Moreover, a Biden administration is likely to restart diplomatic efforts to engage Iran, diminishing Russia’s value to Tehran; re-engage in Syria; and pick up where things left off in 2016 to increase efforts to bring post-Soviet states into the Euro-Atlantic community. From Belarus to Venezuela, the new administration is likely to deploy American diplomatic and economic power to counter Russian efforts.<br>Russia therefore derives no benefit from a Biden administration that is able to restore America’s standing around the world, and the Kremlin, to that extent, has nothing to lose by not hoping that political turmoil within the United States will distract and consume the Biden team in the first months of 2021.<br>For his part, Biden is unlikely to include any

 While a Biden administration will want to see a new arms control agreement in place, the prevailing attitude is that arms control benefits Russia as well and therefore there is no need to try and sweeten the deal, say, by reducing sanctions or agreeing not to target Russian energy projects like Nord Stream 2. Faced with this assessment, the Kremlin, in turn, is not likely to expend a great deal of energy in trying to engage the Biden administration, but it will be anxious to protect its other important relationships from the prospect of U.S. interference.<br>The risk is that, without the disruptive influence of Donald Trump as a factor, U.S. partners that pushed back against Washington’s efforts to curtail their ties with Russia may be more amenable to persuasion from a Biden administration. This may require the Kremlin to find ways to become more accommodating, not only to other governments (for instance, to Emmanuel Macron and a lame-duck Angela Merkel on Ukraine), but also to major multinational companies and international investors. Thus, reducing a series of irritants to close down possible excuses for other countries and firms to re-evaluate their ties with Russia may become a bigger driver in Moscow’s actions.<br>At the same time, as the Kremlin considers questions of transition—reshaping the political system, dealing with the question of a long-term successor to Putin and efforts to jumpstart

 designed to rejuvenate the Russian economy—Moscow may decide that it does not need unnecessary problems in its relationship with the United States. In turn, if the Biden team decides it needs a period of peace and quiet to deal with a post-pandemic recovery, then perhaps Moscow and Washington can re-engage on “strategic stability” dialogue and expand the limited deconfliction process developed for Syria to encompass other flash points around the world. Extending the New START agreement and finding ways to re-instate the Open Skies accords and the INF Treaty would also prevent the relationship from deteriorating further, since arms control may be one of the few non-controversial areas that can pass muster in both Washington and Moscow. It may not be as grandiose as dreams of a strategic partnership—but it is a much more realistic, and achievable, goal.<br>Nikolas K. Gvosdev is the Captain Jerome E.

<br>In 1999, Russia denounced the West's efforts to back Kosovo's Albanian-speaking, largely Muslim rebels as part of a plot to undermine Russian Slavic influence, and threw its support behind Mr. Milosevic, even seizing a Kosovo airfield at one point. The NATO air campaign (conducted without UN authorization) in which Canada participated, eventually brought victory to Kosovo's rebels and helped destabilize Mr. Milosevic.<br>Syria, like Serbia before, has long been a bulwark of Moscow's influence – Russia keeps a navy port there and has long backed Mr. al-Assad as a key instrument of Russian influence in the Middle East. In Russia and its allies, the Syrian rebels are widely seen as agents of a Western plot to seize Mideast influence and threaten Iran.<br>Aside from the unlikelihood of Western bombs falling on Damascus this time, there are two important differences between Kosovo and Syria, and they could extend the Syrian conflict.<br>The first is that while Mr. Milosevic was ultimately willing to negotiate an end to the 1999 conflict – ceding military control of Kosovo and his wider Yugoslavia in order to attempt to keep control of Serbia – Mr. al-Assad has no such compromise option, as he would lose Syria entirely.<br>The second is that while Russia in 1999 was a lone dissenter on the Security Council (then-leader Boris Yeltsin, even after once threatening a nuclear war over Kosovo, was not seen as capable of serious action), there is now a significant anti-Western bloc, dominated by Russia and China in tandem, opposing such actions. These countries allowed the passage last year of UN support for the NATO backing of rebels in Libya, but many members, including Russia, felt that Western countries went too far in Libya and have vowed not to let it happen again.<br>But Russia's greater influence – seen in president Vladimir Putin's outright rejection of British Prime Minister David Cameron's efforts at reconciliation at a meeting during the Olympics, and his decision to send three warships to Syria the next day – does not necessarily put Russia in a desirable position.<br>After all, two rather grim truths underlie the Syria conflict, truths learned from Kosovo and subsequent conflicts: First, the United States does not want its backing of the rebels to extend into an outright military engagement that could easily become intractable. And second, Russia does not really want to tie itself to Mr. al-Assad whose demise is imminent – although it may be forced to do so.<br>

    &quot;I have no doubt that the Russian officials know that Assad will eventually fall, they know that they are putting their interests in the Middle East at risk. But they know that they have invested so much in Assad that they cannot back down. … At some point – and I think there are parallels to Kosovo here – when Assad's position becomes absolutely untenable, and when his regime is falling apart, Russia will at that point return to the Security Council ad want to open negotiations on how to manage the end of the Assad regime.&quot;

 – an expensive liability of the sort that Russia does not need now.<br>And Washington is relying on Saudi Arabia and Qatar to arm the rebels, with covert U.S. technical support, because few in the West believe that Sunni-majority forces will produce a desirable outcome, and many believe they will commit atrocities as acts of revenge.<br>As a reminder, there are still NATO, UN and European Union soldiers and officials stationed in Kosovo, 13 years after that conflict, dealing with periodic flare-ups of ethnic violence. That is enough to prevent either Washington or Moscow from seeking a rerun.</div>

 Russia today offers your administration not only a serious challenge but a significant opportunity.<br>Russia is no longer the Evil Empire the United States confronted over decades of Cold War. Nonetheless, Russia remains a player whose choices affect vital U.S. interests profoundly across the agenda of global issues. First and foremost, Russia remains the only nation that can erase the United States from the map in thirty minutes. Second, Russia is key to preventing nuclear terrorism as well as proliferation of other weapons of mass destruction and missile-delivery systems. Third, Russia’s decisions on whether to share intelligence, or withhold it, significantly affect odds of preventing attacks by terrorists on U.S. citizens and assets across the world. Fourth, Russia is the largest country on Earth by land area, bordering China to the East, Poland in the West, and the United States across the Arctic. (Thus, claims that it is only a “regional” power miss the fact that it abuts every important region.) Fifth, Russia’s Soviet-era scientific establishment and post-Soviet achievements make it a global leader in science and technology, particularly in high-tech military hardware. These talents allow it to mount formidable cyber capabilities, second only to the United States, and to produce impressive weapons. The only way U.S. astronauts can currently travel to and from the International Space Station is to hitch a ride on Russian rockets. The cofounder of the most advanced digital company in the world, Google, is Russian-born Sergey Brin. Sixth, Russia is prepared to fight: it has demonstrated both the capability and the will to use military force to achieve its objectives, from annexing Crimea to bolstering Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria. Seventh, Russia’s potential as a spoiler is difficult to exaggerate—from selling advanced systems like S-300 air defenses to Iran to aligning militarily with China.<br>On their current trajectory, the United States and Russia face a serious risk of stumbling into a war neither side wants and which would be catastrophic for both. You have been elected to change the way Washington does business, and nowhere is that needed more than in dealing with Moscow. While the mainstream press and punditry have panned your campaign pledge to put “America First,” we suggest you remind everyone of the mantra under which both Democratic and Republican presidents fought the Cold War.

 that Americans’ primary purpose in the world was to 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    “preserve the United States as a free nation with our fundamental institutions and values intact.”

 To that end, they set about building a new world order aimed at advancing the cause of peace, prosperity and freedom for all: for Americans, their allies and other nations, in that order. While some now see that hierarchy as shortsightedly selfish or unworthy of a great power, the brute fact is that the survival and success of the United States is the essential prerequisite for American power to be applied to achieve any other objective in the world. As part of your America First doctrine, we urge you to prioritize America’s most vital interests and, from that foundation, engage Russia on what matters most to American citizens’ survival and well-being.<br>In order to understand the way ahead, it may be useful to briefly review how America arrived at the current impasse. Ironically, as we mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the disappearance of the Soviet Union on Christmas Day 1991, U.S. relations with Russia are in their worst state since the high Cold War. All three post–Cold War administrations—Bill Clinton’s, George W. Bush’s and Barack Obama’s—entered office seeking to improve relations with Moscow. Each left office with the relationship in worse condition than when he arrived. President Obama began by announcing

 in relations with Russia to secure Moscow’s cooperation on a number of priorities, including his vision of a world free of nuclear weapons. As his term ends, U.S. and Russian aircraft are operating in close proximity, attacking targets in Syria with minimum communication and no coordination. This risks an unintended collision that could lead to direct conflict. The United States has deployed a “tripwire” force of more than one thousand combat troops between the three frontline Baltic states, and Russia has responded by deploying advanced air defenses and nuclear-capable short-range missiles to its enclave in Kaliningrad. For the first time since the 1980s, military planners on both sides have been reexamining options that include the actual use of nuclear weapons. This outcome serves as a stark reminder that aspirations, however worthy, are not enough. Detached from coherent strategy and sustained operational execution, such aspirations not only predictably fail, but also dash hopes and incite suspicions.<br>Ukraine and Syria offer similar cautionary tales. Having encouraged Ukrainians to rise up against their corrupt, albeit democratically elected, president, the Obama administration and its European allies proved unwilling to mount a military response to Russia’s military intervention. Today, Ukraine is a flailing, almost failing state with no good news in sight. Syria provides a further bloody reminder that where parties are not willing to kill and die for their objectives, others who are will prevail. After announcing a grand objective—“Assad must go”—Obama was unwilling to commit American military forces to achieve that goal, leaving a vacuum that Vladimir Putin stepped in to fill. The point is not that the Obama administration should have sacrificed American lives to defend Syrians. We share the president’s judgment that American national interests do not justify that level of expenditure of American blood and treasure. Rather, the point is that successful strategy requires aligning ends and means. Where the means one is prepared to commit are inadequate to achieve grander objectives, goals must be adjusted accordingly.<br>To compensate for its policy failures, the Obama White House crafted two narratives. On the one hand, it claims that Russia is a loser who

, this is a fantasy: Russia is too big, too powerful and too committed to maintaining its sovereignty as a great power to become a supplicant in an American-dominated world order. Moreover, while the Soviet Union did lose the Cold War and its borders were rolled back to those resembling Catherine the Great’s, unlike Germany and Japan, it was not defeated in a hot war, not occupied and thus not shaped by the United States in the way states whose constitutions were written by the victor were.<br>Kissinger’s alternative—with which we strongly agree—is to seek to integrate Russia into an international order that takes into account Moscow’s minimum essential interests.

 Critically, this would mean treating Putin personally as the strong leader of a major power he clearly is, and is recognized by his fellow citizens to be. It would also mean avoiding gratuitous disrespect.<br>The objective of American policy is not to placate Russia or please Putin. Rather, it is to advance vital U.S. national interests. As seen during Obama’s second term, when treated primarily as a “foe,” Russia can undermine important American objectives. If it can be persuaded to act more as a partner, within the framework of a sustainable, if difficult, working relationship, Moscow can help advance U.S. foreign-policy objectives in a number of ways.<br>First, productive relations between Russia and the United States are essential to avoiding war, including nuclear war. As Washington discovered in the Cold War after the Soviet Union acquired a superpower nuclear arsenal, technology has imposed on the two countries an inescapable partnership and absolute requirement for sufficient cooperation to avoid the nuclear war of which both would be the first victims. Technology has made America and Russia, in effect, Siamese twins. However angry or even disgusted either is at the other, neither can strangle the other without simultaneously committing suicide. This ugly but inescapable fact serves as the starting point in this relationship.<br>While the possibility of an all-out nuclear war remains highly remote, it is no longer as unthinkable as it was when President Obama entered office. Hard as it is to imagine from Washington, Russia’s national-security establishment has become seriously alarmed about what it sees as American developments and plans to undermine its nuclear deterrent. U.S. planners know that America long ago gave up trying to develop a first-strike capability against Russia—because it was unattainable. Nonetheless, even serious Russians now interpret the extraordinary advances in modern warfare the United States has demonstrated since Desert Storm as evidence of a determined plan to achieve advantages in the strategic balance that will provide leverage to coerce Russia. In fact, the United States has redefined modern warfare with ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) that allows it to target precisely any fixed point on earth and to destroy it by multiple non-nuclear means. U.S. special-operations forces are capable of spectacular initiatives, demonstrated in the unannounced raid into Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden or the nightly attacks and raids in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. Advances in ballistic missile defenses, the use of big data in antisubmarine warfare, and in what Russians claim are cyber implants in their nuclear command-and-control system do cause them to worry. No longer is this fear only discussed in classified settings at the Russian national security council.

<br>Russian planners’ response to this fear has been to lower the threshold for their own use of nuclear weapons, organically integrating nuclear attacks earlier in the escalation ladder in what they call hybrid warfare. Moreover, they have developed a dangerous doctrine of

 Most Americans agree. According to a recent poll by the University of Maryland, 67 percent of Republicans and 53 percent of Democrats want the United States to cooperate with Russia to fight ISIS in Syria. Russia’s help in the war on radical Islamic terrorism could go well beyond the battlefields of Syria and Iraq. The difference between a relationship in which the Americans and Russians are sharing intelligence and one in which they are withholding it directly impacts Washington's ability to prevent terrorist attacks on the homeland. This was illustrated vividly by the Boston Marathon bombings, where the after-action review found that Russian security services had previously tipped off their American counterparts about the Tsarnaev brothers—but that the information had been discounted because of the distrust among the parties.<br>Third, Russia is also uniquely suited to help prevent both terrorist organizations like ISIS and Al Qaeda and state actors from acquiring nuclear weapons. As the Soviet Union was coming apart a quarter of a century ago, then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney offered a fatalistic prediction about that country’s nuclear arsenal.

 And yet, twenty-five years on, not a single loose nuclear weapon has been discovered. Moscow’s decision on whether to sell or withhold sensitive technologies can be the difference between failure and success in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, which

<br>Fourth, U.S. strategic interests require preventing an alliance or even alignment between Moscow and Beijing. Short of a formal alliance, which neither seems to seek at this point, Russia’s backing will embolden China to take tougher positions in confronting the United States.

 of the twentieth century. A fierce patriot, he is determined to assert Russia’s role as a great power of which his fellow citizens can be proud.

 away. The challenge is thus to advance U.S. interests in areas where they converge with Russia’s and manage differences in areas where they diverge.<br>As the first step in crafting of such a policy, we recommend that your administration develop a clear hierarchy of American priorities. Unless you define the difference between the vivid and the vital—distinguishing between the bright new shiny object of the day, on the one hand, and what is essential to America, on the other—your administration will find itself following its predecessors in engaging in optional pursuits at the expense of what is absolutely necessary. We recommend beginning with

<br>Second, in this spirit you should prepare carefully for an early one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin to change the dynamics in the relationship. Relations between nations involve much more than their leaders’ personal relationship. But poisonous disrespect at the top seeps down through the layers of interactions between the governments. Alternatively, where the leaders signal mutual respect, establish a working relationship and demonstrate a determination to do business where mutual interests allow, others at successive layers in their governments can find productive opportunities. Reestablishing a relationship of minimal trust requires clarity about areas of disagreement as well as agreement and red lines that cannot be crossed.<br>Third, your meeting with Putin should be followed by revival of government-to-government dialogue with Russia, beginning with ways to prevent an accidental war between the United States and Russia, including nuclear war. Overturning President Obama’s ban on communication at every level from president-to-president to secretaries of defense, military chiefs and regional commanders; more rigorous deconflicting in Syria; revitalization of U.S.-Russia agreements on preventing military incidents and other confidence-building measures in the military-to-military domain; and establishing rules of the game for cyber operations—these and many similar initiatives can help reduce the risk of an unintended war with Russia. This should also include working to preserve cornerstones of the bilateral strategic nuclear balance, including the New Start Treaty and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.<br>Fourth, you should change the overall U.S. approach toward the Syrian conflict. Business as usual would do the United States no good. As

 In Syria, the current approach not only risks an accidental confrontation with Russia; it distracts from the U.S. campaign to destroy terrorist forces there and alienates regional allies. American military commanders have concluded that the United States has no credible military option to prevail. Russia’s military deployments in Syria and the Eastern Mediterranean have made no-fly zones unrealistic, and further arming the rebels is more likely to lead to escalation than to Moscow’s retreat. Alternatively, to switch sides and act in concert with Russia and Assad would run a major risk of angering U.S. allies and further strengthening Iran. As one of your first foreign-policy steps, we recommend that you order a review of the Syrian crisis with a view to developing a fundamentally new policy. That policy would be more open to cooperation with Russia in defeating ISIS and Al Qaeda, and less focused on removing Assad, but would also demonstrate that America will not allow Moscow and/or Tehran to impose a solution in Syria.<br>Fifth, though you have previously expressed skepticism about greater U.S. involvement in resolution of the Ukraine conflict, we believe you should join the efforts of European powers to find a solution, if only because this conflict also risks military confrontation with Moscow. While the cease-fire between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists is mostly holding, it is dangerous to leave the conflict not-quite-frozen. As in Syria, there are forces on the ground not entirely under the control of either Kiev or Moscow that have their own agendas and welcome occasional skirmishes. These battles can easily escalate beyond their control. There are no good military solutions. Neither the United States nor its European allies are prepared to challenge Russia militarily so close to its borders.<br>If the United States is not in a position to defeat Russia and its allies in Ukraine militarily, it is imperative to offer Moscow a solution that Russian leaders would consider at least minimally acceptable.

 We share his optimism, and believe a suitable formula would include: implementation of the Minsk agreements with concessions by both sides, reestablishing Kiev’s control over Donetsk and Luhansk but providing these two regions with genuine autonomy, and assurances that Ukraine would not join NATO for as far as the eye can see. This latter commitment should not be difficult to honor, because the United States and most major European powers do not want Ukraine in NATO in any foreseeable future.<br>A genuinely different approach toward the Ukrainian and Syrian conflicts should incorporate credible strength and creative diplomacy to produce outcomes favorable to the United States. To demonstrate its strength, America should use military deployments and private warnings (so as to avoid publicly cornering Putin) to communicate to Moscow that unilateral solutions will not work in either Syria or Ukraine. The key is to show that the United States and its allies will be able to provide enough support to the rebels in Syria and to the government in Kiev to make sure that both conflicts are unsolvable on Moscow’s terms without prohibitive costs to Russia. This also means showing that whoever the United States chooses to support will gain strength over time, which encourages serious negotiations sooner rather than later.<br>Sixth, you should strengthen U.S. military capabilities in ways that simultaneously dissuade Russia from aggression (both overt and covert) against NATO allies in Europe and respect Russia’s legitimate interest in ethnic Russians living in the former Soviet Union. It is almost impossible for the United States to have too big a stick. But by far the most likely paths to military conflict with Russia begin not with a premeditated Russian attack, but with an unintended event, for example, an incident between nationals and ethnic Russians in one of the Baltics that creates a crisis in which Putin concludes he must intervene. NATO is the greatest alliance in history and played an essential role in America’s Cold War victory. But today, it stands in need of substantial reform. Europe is presently itself in crisis. The failure of the EU economies to grow since the Great Recession, Brexit, uncertainties about who may be Nexit, an unending stream of immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa, and an inability to control its own borders—all these raise fundamental questions about the viability of the European project. Given these challenges, the United States should not allow itself to become a lightning rod—or scapegoat. Thus we urge you to reiterate America’s commitment to NATO, including Article Five security guarantees, at the outset. But Washington should also propose that NATO members undertake a zero-based reassessment of the alliance. In his inaugural address,

 European leaders should ask less what America can do for them and more what they can do for European security.<br>Your effort will be aided by an overall increase in U.S. military capabilities, much as President Ronald Reagan’s diplomatic outreach to the Soviet Union benefited from a perception in Moscow that the United States was changing the balance of power in its favor after a period of decline. This is especially important at a time when Russia’s defense production is poised to grow by 10 percent this year, despite economic pressure. Combining investment in U.S. capabilities with calculated use of your reputation for unpredictability could be particularly useful, much as Nixon cultivated the image of a “madman” to enhance his leverage in Southeast Asia. An early demonstration of your resolve might also be necessary—when suitable circumstances arise—to change Russian perceptions of the costs of ignoring U.S. preferences.<br>At the same time, we urge you to follow through on your campaign pledge to persuade Europe to contribute more to the alliance. Since European NATO members are the principal beneficiaries of the security guarantee, and they collectively exceed the United States in population and rival it in gross domestic product, they should pay a significantly larger share of the costs.

 Like all alliances, NATO is valuable to the extent that it advances and defends other American national interests—it is an instrument, not the icon that some in Europe (and particularly Central Europe) would understandably like it to be.<br>Accordingly, the United States should reiterate its commitment to defend the Baltic states from naked aggression, in concert with other allies, but insist that the Baltic governments themselves attempt to normalize relations with Moscow and meet the highest international standards in ensuring the rights of ethnic Russians. The goal must be to prevent incidents that could provide a temptation—or excuse—for Russian intervention. There should be no illusions that America accepts responsibility for allies who provoke conflict and then request assistance and reassurance to deal with the consequences.<br>Seventh, the United States should never apologize for its values, for its belief that basic human rights are the endowment of all human beings and its conviction that democracy is the best form of government. This is who America is. Nonetheless, we recommend communicating to Putin that regime change is not America’s objective. As a recent superpower still nostalgic for its past glory, Russia is particularly sensitive to efforts to shape its domestic processes. We suggest treating Russia the way the United States treats other undemocratic nations with whom it is friendly, such as Saudi Arabia.<br>Eighth, we encourage your administration to give greater consideration to Russia’s possible and likely responses in making policy decisions. Today, Russia is almost an afterthought in U.S. national security decisionmaking. In selecting individuals for key positions dealing with Russia, it will be important to appoint those both willing and able to implement your policy.<br>Ninth, you should seek ways to expand the economic foundation of the bilateral relationship. Though Russia has the sixth-largest economy in the world (measured in terms of purchasing parity), it ranks thirty-seventh among buyers of American products. With more than thirty years of experience in dealing with Russia as a businessman, you can bring unprecedented insights into ways to address this issue.<br>Last but not least, you should recognize that any meaningful attempt to pursue a new beginning with Moscow will face fierce opposition from some in Congress, many in the media and more of the bureaucracy than you imagine. Having a strong national-security team—and explaining that in reaching out to Russia you will not abandon important U.S. interests—should be sufficient to assure those who are willing to wait and see. Still, there will be vigorous opposition to any realistic engagement with Russia. Some are irreconcilably hostile to Russia. Thus, for your sharp turn in policy to succeed, you will need to make your case directly to the American people—something you have done many times during the campaign. If Americans clearly understand that the current path leads inexorably to a crossroad at which the U.S. and Russian presidents will have to choose between humiliation and nuclear confrontation, they too will move beyond the wishful thinking that has thus far prevented the United States from effectively pursuing its real national interests.<br>Graham Allison is the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School and principal investigator of the Russia Matters Project.<br>Dimitri K.

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Minsk and Moscow are like an old married couple; they tend to air their long-standing grievances in public. This time, a dispute over compensating Belarus for a Russian oil tax maneuver prompted Moscow to revisit the oldest disagreement: the 1999 Union Treaty that has never been implemented. Russia issued Belarus what sounded like an ultimatum: financial support in return for greater integration with the Russian state. But with the constitution preventing Russian President Vladimir Putin from seeking another term after 2024, many viewed the ultimatum as a threat. A barrage of publications, official statements, and even anonymous social media posts claimed that the annexation of Belarus is inevitable. Such a move, the theory goes, would then allow Putin to become president of the Russian-Belarusian Union State. Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, analysts cannot entirely rule out this possibility. That said, we can assess the current likelihood of the annexation scenario and disprove some myths common among those predicting it. Let’s start with a foundational myth. Many Russians incorrectly believe that capricious Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is the only obstacle preventing Belarus—the most Soviet of former Soviet republics—from happily joining the Russian Federation. However, in reality, the number of Belarusians who support the country’s independence has steadily and consistently grown. Twenty-eight years of living in a separate state with all its legal and political attributes—an entire generation of people raised in an independent Belarus—have affected the nation’s collective identity.<br>Even if the majority of Belarusians support a union with Russia, they don’t see it as a future merger of the two countries. Polls show that 55–75 percent of people steadily support the country’s current level of integration with Russia. But when asked to choose between Belarus’s unification with Russia and the country’s sovereignty, only 15–20 percent are willing to support deeper integration, and less than 5 percent would want to see Belarus as a part of Russia. Moreover—unlike in Ukraine, Moldova, or Kazakhstan—Belarusian supporters of Russia aren’t confined to certain areas of the country. There is no Belarusian Crimea or Donbas that could be used to destabilize the Minsk government. Unlike pro-Western Belarusians, Russia supporters lack their own political force. They aren’t mobilized, even by the standards of Belarus’s rather indifferent society. And they don’t face discrimination on the basis of language or cultural differences, so they can’t allege that Minsk and Western Belarusian nationalists trample upon their Russian identity. Nor is Belarusian support for a Russia-oriented foreign policy unanimous. When offered not just the choice of

 up to 60 percent of Belarusians pick the neutral path. If the Belarusian authorities opt for a neutral foreign policy, the majority of the country’s population will enthusiastically support this position. Even the so-called “Soviet Belarusians,” who completely reject any nationalist aspirations, see Russia as a country of oligarchs, social inequality, corruption, crime, and bad roads. When these people—most of whom are public sector employees and senior citizens—wax nostalgic about the “big country,” that country more resembles today’s Belarus than Russia in terms of social policy.<br>Thus, Belarus may appear a surprisingly pro-Russian and Russian-speaking country, but Moscow will most likely fail to find its base among Belarusians. In fact, joining Russia has been a taboo subject in Belarusian politics for many years. Even the country’s communists take independence as a given. And the authorities have demonstrated that they are prepared to harshly punish those who dare cross this political red line. In 2017, commentators expressing excessively pro-Russian views found themselves charged with provoking interethnic strife and held in pretrial detention for a year. Moreover, it’s difficult to cobble together

 in a country that lacks genuine political parties and a developed network of nongovernmental organizations. Besides, Belarus is an authoritarian state that will instantly crack down on any attempt to destabilize the regime. The Belarusian authorities censor critical statements on Russian TV, are willing to block popular social networks, and have never shied away from arresting and preventatively detaining opposition activists. These measures are traditionally aimed at the pro-Western opposition, but the repressive state apparatus can crush pro-Russian protests too. But let’s imagine that the takeover of Belarus happens. Will the Belarusian people resist occupation? A June 2015 poll suggests 19 percent of Belarusians would be willing to take up arms. But this question is too hypothetical to be taken seriously. Much would depend upon how the conflict developed and the positions of elite and security forces factions. Furthermore, like Ukraine, Belarus has several national-democratic and nationalist parties that view Russia as an aggressive empire that poses an eternal threat to Belarusian independence. An actual takeover attempt would likely stoke these sentiments, leading to mass protests in large cities.<br>More importantly, no one—including Moscow—can be sure there won’t be serious resistance. Hence, in planning a takeover, Russia would need to be ready to crush public protests and overcome guerilla warfare. Beyond this, the Belarusian political regime is the fundamental obstacle to the country’s close integration with anyone. Authoritarian rulers cannot share their power—not inside the country, not with external forces. Aside from some drastic personal threats, it’s difficult to imagine what Moscow can offer Lukashenko to induce him to give up his power. Money, a yacht, or a Sochi villa doesn’t come close to the opportunities and status afforded by being in full control of an average-sized European country. Thus, the only option that remains for Russia is to provoke a split within the Belarusian elite and foster a pro-Russian faction in its midst. But this path is hardly straightforward. While the Belarusian ruling class is not uniform in its views—it consists of pro-European diplomats, pro-market technocrats, conservative security operatives, communist factory directors, and just plain career-oriented government officials—it is united by its enduring loyalty to Lukashenko. The Belarusian president has a monopoly on foreign policy and integration questions. No government official is allowed to venture outside of the president’s position on these issues. Moreover, many (if not all) high-ranking government officials have benefited from the country’s sovereignty. After leaving public service, they can enjoy a carefree life in a small and well-managed country that has not been divvied up into zones of influence by oligarchs. Were the two countries to merge, the arrival of Russian big business to Belarus could deprive these officials of both their current positions and their peaceful retirements. Even if there are dyed-in-the-wool Russophiles in the Belarusian government, betraying the country’s leader carries excessive personal risk—especially when the plot’s success is far from guaranteed. One could lose everything—including his or her freedom—by so much as flirting with Moscow. This is doubly the case in a system where government officials justifiably fear monitoring by the security services.<br>The author writes that the Kremlin's demands that Belarus pursue further integration with the Russian state in exchange for financial support have raised fears of annexation. In Russia, many believe that most Belarusians support joining the Russian Federation, with President Alexander Lukashenko as the primary obstacle blocking unification. This is not the case, as in polls, the majority of Belarusians support independence. Unlike in Ukraine, the few supporters of Russian integration are not confined geographically and do not experience the same degree of language- or culture-based discrimination. Thus,

 At no time in modern American history has such a public fissure between the president and the intelligence services occurred.<br>Regardless of the veracity of the report’s claims, which the FBI are allegedly now investigating, what is clear is that Trump will assume power as a faux-populist utterly committed to a new Russophile American foreign policy posture – one that largely dispenses with notions of soft power and moral influence, and that curries favour with other strongmen as a way to carve the world up into spheres of control. He has made it abundantly clear that he will seek a close relationship with Putin, the strongman leader of a foreign power that, for the last three quarters of a century, in both its Communist incarnation and its newly minted nationalist one, has been regarded with suspicion and fear by most western policy makers. To minimize the significance of what would, in normal times, be viewed by much of the American electorate as a deeply troubling relationship, Trump will be banking on his ability to whip up the mob against the hostility – nay, the horror – of the country’s traditional power-elites.<br>If the tycoon’s gamble fails, he will be a toothless buffoon, detested by most members of the Republican-led Senate, tolerated by Congress so long as he delivers on tax cuts, conservative judicial nominations, and other staples of GOP ideology; but vulnerable to non-cooperation on his agenda and perhaps ultimately to threats of impeachment as soon as he attempts to go his own way on foreign policy, on protectionist trade policies, or, perhaps, if his Twitter-based mob politics unleashes serious domestic unrest.<br>But if Trump’s gamble succeeds – if he really is able, through tweets and victory rallies, to marshal

 Let no one accuse the next president of understatement.<br>Trump is no fool. Despite his bluster, he knows the precarious position that the CIA and the publishing of the findings on the Russia-hack has landed him in. After all, if he were a Democrat sullied with an intelligence assessment that Putin’s Russia had attempted to influence his election, senators and commentators would be lining up to attack him – don’t forget, Trump’s supporters frequently called for Clinton to be locked up for her use of an insecure email server.<br>It’s not in Trump’s nature to back down. When under threat, he goes on the attack. And so, to no one’s surprise, in his press conference on Wednesday he doubled-down.

<br>If the intelligence community doesn’t buy that, Trump’s shown a willingness to swing at them as much as at his more traditional scapegoats. All of this makes it likely that in addition to going after left-wing protesters, undocumented immigrants, the media, and intellectuals, his team, banking on the support of this “movement” of angry Americans, could over the coming months also purge the top ranks of the military and the intelligence agencies of those who oppose the pivot to Putin.<br>Trump’s vision of the world is clear. It is the vision of Cecil Rhodes, who famously said that he would colonize the stars if he had the opportunity – although in fairness to Rhodes it is not delineated in nearly as poetic language. It is the world of Louis Napoleon, who was bedazzled by images of Empire floating in front of his myopic eyes. It is a planet divided into

 into those born to wield power, wealth, and influence, and those born to serve. It is colonialism with exclamation marks in place of self-serving philosophical justifications for conquest. It is Empire without literature and void of culture. It is a sort of post-literate bluster without panache.<br>In Trump’s world, military super-powers have no need to cajole and to seduce – with promises, however illusory, of expanded prosperity, with a culture other countries want to emulate, or with lip service paid to ideals of universal human rights and democracy. In Trump’s world, might is quite simply right. The U.S. has nuclear weapons and a vastly powerful military, and it should be willing to use them anywhere it needs to impose order.<br>Of course, idealistic language notwithstanding, as Chileans, Cubans, Vietnamese, and so many others know to their cost, America has long acted as an episodic bully and trigger-happy international policeman. To a degree, Trump’s rhetoric and temperament is merely an extension of existing trends. Yet there is also something qualitatively different in the way he sees America’s place in the world. His impatience with nuance, with the subtleties and long time frames of diplomacy, with the idea of an international order at least partly mediated by supranational institutions, with the give-and-take inherent in bodies such as the United Nations, makes him a natural ally of Putin, as well as of Erdogan in Turkey and Modi in India. These men, all so willing to treat opponents as enemies, and racial or religious minorities as fifth columns, are the heralds of a new strongman order.<br>Trump’s reaching out to Putin isn’t a modern-day example of Ostpolitik, the eminently sensible Cold War-era policy of accommodation that Willie Brandt’s Germany pursued with the Warsaw Pact. It isn’t an acknowledgement that different systems can – and in the nuclear age must – learn to co-exist, to co-operate where necessary and to replace military responses to disagreements with dialogue. Rather it is a clear statement of preference: temperamentally, Trump is most comfortable dealing with autocrats. He praises Putin but barely mentions the leaders of western democracies with whom America has allied for decades. He is at home with populist, sometimes aggresive, leaders of militarily powerful countries, and at ease talking with those strongmen about how to crack down on domestic opposition and how to deal with other, smaller, weaker, nations.<br>The Trump-Putin axis that is emerging will reshape the world profoundly. The two largest nuclear powers, banded together to stamp out

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">While Ukraine has exceeded the initial expectations of many war experts and seems likely to remain on the front foot against the Russian forces that have invaded the country, with this optimism to a large extent attributable to the continued support it has been receiving from the West and the high morale displayed by the Ukrainian troops, the next few months of the war will likely be especially difficult and may be characterized by protracted standoffs rather than opportunities for major counteroffensives for the Ukrainians.

 on the battlefield as essentially synonymous with continued death and destruction, civilians in many areas of Ukraine who are located quite far from the major theatres of the conflict (such as those based in populated areas in central and western Ukraine) remain vulnerable to missile and drone strikes that are often indiscriminately launched by Russia.<br>The possibility of a further deterioration in the situation on the ground for Ukrainian non-combatants, especially due to critical civilian infrastructure remaining a target for Russian attacks, coupled with the Western countries’ increased willingness to call the Putin administration’s bluffs with regard to the regime’s nuclear threats, may be regarded as a signal that the time has arrived to revisit a Polish proposal dating back to the early phases of the war, which advocated for the deployment of a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine.<br>Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński was the first one to officially suggest such an idea when the top politicians of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia traveled to Kyiv in March 2022 in order to meet with top Ukrainian politicians. At the time the details regarding the strategic planning were lacking, but it was clear that the intention was to have a peacekeeping mission under the auspices of NATO or another international structure that was to operate in the Ukrainian territories, which were not occupied by Russia, potentially securing safe havens for civilians. The peacekeepers were to have the backing of armed forces, though with a mandate that precluded the latter from proactively engaging the Russian troops.<br>The Polish idea generally received a frosty reception, failing to gather steam, with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg reluctant to discuss it, and it was also viewed with skepticism by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, a year later there are clear indications that the Western countries’ security calculus over Ukraine has changed.<br>Firstly, a number of signs are present that the West is currently significantly more willing, in comparison to the spring of 2022, to make moves that could be appraised as escalatory by Russia. As stated by Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba in February 2023, Ukraine has already received six out of the seven types of key weapons needed for the liberation of the country. Furthermore, since early 2023, there is some evidence that the Biden administration has started to be accepting of the idea of providing support to Ukraine to the extent that Russia’s control of Crimea could be put under threat. Thus, the West appears to be prepared to cross what used to be described as a major red line, due to Crimea, which first came under Russian rule in 1783, being viewed as clearly constituting an integral part of the Russian federation by Putin.<br>The greater confidence and boldness displayed by the West is arguably a reflection of new insights gained into the Putin administration’s modus operandi – concerns pertaining to the Russian side being open to the possibility of launching a tactical nuclear weapon as part of its war strategy, which were frequently raised during the initial stages of the war, appear to be waning. Thus, the trepidation that deploying military personnel for a peacekeeping mission will be vastly irresponsible due to setting in motion events that could potentially trigger a nuclear Armageddon does not appear to have a high degree of credibility.<br>Western policymakers also need to be cognizant of the reality that the Putin regime itself considers the West and NATO as already being at war with the Russian state. In that regard, Western analysts such as journalist Christopher Caldwell, noting that certain weapons provided to Ukraine are embedded into an American information network (with some precise details actually not shared with the Ukrainians), which contributes to their destructive power, advance the claim that the United States is in essence already a participant rather than merely a provider of materials for the military operations against Russia.<br>In addition to the abovementioned considerations, the Western countries could refer back to the events of 15 November 2022 when a missile landed in the village of Przewodów in Poland (located near the border with Ukraine), amidst a large Russian strike campaign on Ukraine, resulting in two Polish fatalities. While in that particular instance the explosion was caused by the firing of a Ukraine defense missile, Stoltenberg was adamant that Russia was ultimately to blame for the incident. Thus, it could still plausibly be argued by the West that discouraging Russia from engaging in indiscriminate missile strikes against Ukrainian territories where no battles are currently being waged is perfectly aligned with NATO interests and European security, as it is worth avoiding a repeat of a situation that causes the life and well-being of the citizens of a NATO country to be directly threatened.<br>As for the Ukrainian president’s own reservations regarding the Polish proposal, the shifting context needs to be taken into account. In March 2022 Zelenskyy still viewed Russia as capable of engaging in good faith peace negotiations and was prepared to discuss Ukrainian neutrality as well as repudiate claims to future NATO membership. However, the subsequent discovery of gruesome war crimes such as those committed in Bucha as well as Russia’s refusal to cede conquered territories, claiming that

 has caused Zelenskyy to no longer perceive peace talks initiated by Russia as being likely to result in a viable solution to the conflict, as long as Putin remains president.<br>All in all, even if solely taking Western cost-benefit calculations into account, it does not seem too likely that a humanitarian mission would necessarily accentuate the perception of escalation from the standpoint of the Putin administration, especially given that the West is clearly on a trajectory of increasing support for Ukraine. Targeting NATO personnel on a peacekeeping mission as a result of the launching of missile strikes, even if the Russian government could potentially play the plausible deniability game and claim that it was by no means intentional, is unlikely to be evaluated as a risk worth taking by Russia. In the aftermath of the aforementioned missile explosion incident that occurred on Polish territory, the Russian Defense Ministry was quick to emphasize that there had been no Russian strikes in areas closer than 35 km from the border between Poland and Ukraine, with the Kremlin even praising Biden’s

 to the incident, possibly looking at the US president’s apparent willingness to downplay the implications of the incident with a sense of relief. Such reactions on the part of Russia suggest that Putin and other Russian officials’ bellicose rhetoric pertaining to nuclear weapons notwithstanding, the Russian government is perfectly aware of the inherent risks for their country in case Western or NATO personnel suffer any casualties as a result of Russian aggression. As stated by Alexander Vindman, a former director of European affairs in the National Security Council, during Biden’s visit to Kyiv on 20 February 2023, from the perspective of Ukrainian civilians, the city was likely at its safest since the start of the war.<br>While there is still an innate aversion in Western circles to any courses of action that could be deemed as the equivalent of

 a limited peacekeeping operation may save thousands of civilian lives, essentially guarantee that the conflict will be confined to the Donbass (and some other territories in the vicinity), prove that the United States does not allow its foreign policy to be dictated by nuclear brinksmanship, and most importantly solidify the Ukrainian resolve, as such a course of action would go beyond a powerful statement of intent on the part of the West, showing that the latter literally has Ukraine’s back. It will also provide a very strong rebuttal to the accusations (often made by offensive realists and by analysts on the right side of the political spectrum) that the West is merely interested in weakening Russia by sacrificing Ukrainians and is not willing to walk the talk with regard to any risk-taking behaviors.<br>The views expressed in this article belong to the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect those of Geopoliticalmonitor.com.</div>

China has promised billions of dollars to Central Asian countries as evidence that Beijing is undertaking an impressive development campaign, and is now the dominant economic power in the region, eclipsing Russia. However, the Kremlin still has cultural and political influence in Central Asia. The main difference between China’s actions and the Marshall Plan is that China is not demanding political change, but only seeking economic opportunity. The author argues that Chinese development plans are beneficial to all the countries involved and even to neighboring countries, including Russia and those in Europe.<br>Read the full text at the Central Asia-Caucasus Analyst.<br>Temuri Yakobashvili is a Senior Transatlantic Fellow at the German Marshall Fund.<br>Photo by Holger.Elgaard shared under a CC BY 3.0 license.</div>

It is a story of political ups and downs, unexpected turns of events, and conflicting narratives.<br>With mass anti-corruption demonstrations in Moscow and other Russian cities on March 26, followed by a terrorist attack in St. Petersburg on April 3, Kremlin elites are growing nervous.<br>Opposition leader Aleksey Navalny, now imprisoned, sparked a wave of public protest when his foundation uncovered a web of criminality and corruption encircling Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev’s hidden wealth, which includes lavish properties, yachts, and wineries, makes him one of the richest people in Russia.<br>According to polls conducted by the independent Levada Center, nearly 80% of Russians believe that both the federal as well as central authorities are thoroughly corrupt.

 attitude. This time, however, they reacted spontaneously. Inspired by Navalny they took their disappointment to the street. Thousands protested peacefully throughout the entirety of Russia. Many demonstrators were detained. Some, after a brief prosecution, were sentenced to prison. The head of the anti-corruption movement, Aleksey Navalny, is serving a 15-day sentence for agitating illegal rallies.<br>Generation Putin<br>There has been one feature that distinguishes the March events from the last 2011 outcry against the rigged parliamentary elections – the engagement of the Putin generation.<br>Political consciousness of young people under 18, for whom domestic politics has always been associated with President Vladimir Putin, is slowly awakening.<br>Anti-corruption slogans have constituted only a part of their demands. They struggle for increasingly limited social and urban space and the right to freely express oneself. For Russian youth the everyday reality does not match the pro-government propaganda broadcast by tightly controlled media. State communication channels have developed a narrative of Russia as a besieged fortress. And one of the ways to protect the fortress is to make sure everyone toes the line internally.<br>As the Russian economy is going through serious disturbances, the lack of foreign investments is increasingly problematic and the promised high-tech revolution bears no fruit, the Kremlin desperately looks for a theme that could serve to distract the public. The 2014 annexation of Crimea and the ongoing confrontation with the West, as recently outlined by a Russian sociologist Denis Volkov in an article for RBK daily, no longer serve that purpose. In the vacuum that has emerged, anti-corruption actions, which resonate well with the people, have become a political springboard for Navalny.<br>At first an official reaction to the protest was limited to a prolonged silence on behalf of the Kremlin. Only after three days since the demonstrations have taken place, the authorities recognized them. Until then state TV channels have not run a single report covering the events.<br>However, it would be naïve to think that there will be an investigation concerning Prime Minister Medvedev’s circle. Medvedev himself comments on Navalny’s work reluctantly. His press secretary Natalya Timakova said it senseless to react to the corruption accusations due to the lack of credible evidence. Prime Minister’s political protector Vladimir Putin has (as of yet) no reasons to question Medvedev’s loyalty. The status quo will be maintained and no one will be held responsible.<br>Civil cold war<br>Some Russian analysts believe that a new civil cold war in Russia has broken out. This is a rather premature interpretation as the protesters are not in any way an institutionalized grouping. Also President Putin’s grasp on power is as firm as ever. For nearly two decades he has positioned himself as the only guarantor of stability and peace. His authority has never been questioned.<br>The recent terrorist attack in Petersburg changes the political dynamics in Russia. Vladimir Putin can now carry out a counter-assault directed both at radicals as well as internal opposition.<br>The 1999 bombings in Russia and the Second Chechen War they led to enabled Putin to consolidate power in the run-up to the presidential elections the following year. The March 2017 demonstrations and the metro attack in Petersburg that followed will serve a similar purpose. Putin will capitalize on the fear of people and he will project the image of the only one that could curb those who want to destabilize the domestic situation in Russia.<br>What to expect from the Russian authorities in the short-term perspective? Both incidents might lead to the implementation of even more severe restrictions on the freedom of internet in Russia. When it comes to non-parliament opposition it could also experience another wave of sanctions including administrative impediments and controls.<br>President Vladimir Putin has said on many occasions, quoting Russian poet Fyodor Tyutchev, that for insight on Russia one should not use a brain. In Russia one can only believe. Such an approach invites citizens’ passiveness and the conviction that no change is possible and the authorities have the monopoly on truth.<br>A marked transformation of Russia is however feasible. Historically, it required an extraordinary individual like Peter the Great to shape the foundations of the nation and move the country forward. Today, this role could be played by young civil, urban, and cultural activists, who deserve Western moral support.</div>

 in Syria. This, according to the White House, will help in the negotiations of a truce. But from Moscow’s perspective, it will not: it is the use of force that drives the negotiation process in a direction favored by the Kremlin. Russia has become reliant on the use of force to change facts on the ground in order to strengthen its negotiating position.<br>The Kremlin’s foreign policy tool kit is severely limited. Moscow has made some half-hearted attempts at projecting soft power, but it has never been strategic or credible at it. After the annexation of Crimea and a number of other unilateral moves, the level of trust between Moscow and the West is as low as it might have been at the height of the “first” Cold War.<br>What many in the West see as successful, if aggressive, foreign policy, Moscow apparently sees as its external line of defense against Western mischief and attempts at regime change in Russia.<br>Absent mutual trust or credibility, the Kremlin prefers conflicts around Russia to keep simmering. Being able to turn the heat on and off is one of the few credible foreign policy levers Moscow still has. But the price for constantly relying on this crude tool is Russian society’s continued disassociation from its neighbors — Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, even Belarus. By the same token, Moscow has now succeeded in making formidable enemies among the Sunni powers, especially Saudi Arabia and Turkey. It is worth keeping in mind that the Syrian situation is very different from the Ukrainian one. Turkey is as involved in Syria as Russia is involved in Ukraine.<br>The foreign policies of Moscow and Washington are expressions of two very different political narratives. Putin’s foreign policy was prepared by years of perceived humiliation and Western encirclement. One domestic reform Moscow has been very particular about is the reform of the military.

These internal communications reveal nothing flattering about the DNC or Hillary Clinton, who is set to be anointed as the Democrats’ presidential nominee at their party convention in Philadelphia that gets underway with fanfare today.<br>Wikileaks has thrown an ugly wrench into Hillary’s coronation. DNC emails reveal a Clinton campaign that’s shady and dishonest, not to mention corrupt. Its secret dealings with Hillary’s opponents—whether Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump—have been distasteful and possibly illegal. To say this is an unflattering portrayal of Team Clinton is like saying the Titanic had issues with ice.<br>The ramifications of this massive leak are already serious.

 got its hands on them.<br>It turns out there’s hardly any mystery there. It’s no secret that the DNC was recently subject to a major hack, one which independent cybersecurity experts easily assessed as being the work of Russian intelligence through previously known cut-outs. One of them, called COZY BEAR or APT 29, has used spear-phishing to gain illegal access to many private networks in the West, as well as the White House, the State Department, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff last year. Another hacking group involved in the attack on the DNC, called FANCY BEAR or APT 28, is a well-known Russian front, as I’ve previously profiled.<br>These bears didn’t make much efforts to hide their DNC hack—in one case leaving behind a Russian name in Cyrillic as a signature—and Kremlin attribution has been confirmed by independent analysis by a second cybersecurity firm.<br>The answer then is simple: Russian hackers working for the Kremlin cyber-pilfered the DNC then passed the purloined data, including thousands of unflattering emails, to Wikileaks, which has shown them to the world.<br>This, of course, means that Wikileaks is doing Moscow’s bidding and has placed itself in bed with Vladimir Putin. In response to the data-dump, the DNC has said as much and the Clinton campaign has endorsed the view that Moscow prefers Donald Trump in this election, and it’s using Wikileaks to harm Hillary. This view, considered bizarre by most people as late as last week, is being taken seriously by the White House—as it should be.<br>In truth, to anyone versed in counterintelligence and Russian espionage tradecraft, Wikileaks has been an obvious Kremlin front for years, and it’s nice to see the Democrats and their allies in the mainstream media suddenly come around to this view—which I’ve stated publicly since 2013, based on my long experience working against Russian security agencies in the SpyWar.<br>Wikileaks came to international prominence in 2010 when it released online a quarter-million classified State Department cables that had been stolen by disgruntled Army Private Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning. This was a huge black mark for then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and unleashed a global scandal.<br>There’s nothing new about Wikileaks or its key role in the Kremlin’s international propaganda apparatus.<br>Wikileaks was founded in 2006, ostensibly as

 and in reality as a vanity project by the Australian hacktivist Julian Assange, who has been hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since mid-2012, on the run from rape charges in Sweden. It’s unclear when the group’s ties to the Kremlin were forged, but it’s obvious they existed by the time Wikileaks took center stage in the Edward Snowden case in mid-2013.<br>The role of Wikileaks in the Snowden saga would be difficult to overstate, not least since Assange was the one who counseled the American IT contractor to seek sanctuary in Russia. Snowden left Hong Kong for Moscow in June 2013—where he remains—based on Assange’s advice and accompanied by Sarah Harrison, a top Wikileaks official and Assange intimate.<br>Why Assange recommended that the NSA contractor on the lam seek Putin’s protection is an important question.

One might think that seeking the shelter of the FSB—one of the world’s nastiest secret police forces that spies on millions without warrant and murders opponents freely—might be an odd choice for a “privacy organization.” But Wikileaks is no ordinary NGO.<br>Why Assange knew Russia would take in Snowden—it could be a big political hassle for Moscow—is a key question that any counterintelligence officer would want answered.

Why is a very good question that anybody who’s looking into Wikileaks ought to ask.<br>All the same, Assange’s affection for the Kremlin and its intelligence agencies is nothing new and was something I wrote about fully three years ago, as the Snowden story was breaking. This revolved around Israel Shamir, an anti-Semitic nutcase who’s been in the Wikileaks orbit for many years, serving as a close confidant to Assange and his go-to guy on Russian matters. As I

 back in July 2013:<br>So who is Israel Shamir? That’s not an easy question to answer with much certainty. His official biography states that he was born in the Soviet Union in 1947 and emigrated to Israel in 1969, but little of his curriculum vitae stands up to detailed scrutiny. He admits to having something like a half-dozen different identities, complete with aliases. Of greatest interest here is that, before he became famous for his Wikileaks links, he was best known as a neo-Nazi holocaust denier in European circles. Which is a pretty rare thing for a Jew and Israeli citizen to get mixed up in.<br>Shamir, operating under several names, is noted for his anti-Semitic vitriol and is fond of extolling the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and hanging out with Nordic neo-Nazis. His views are so strange and vehement that many have wondered if Shamir’s is actually an agent provocateur on behalf of some intelligence service.

 In all, Shamir’s a pretty odd choice as Wikileaks’ go-to guy for Russia.<br>Although Wikileaks has semi-denied that Shamir is on their payroll, Shamir himself has been abundantly clear who he works for. The secret services had this oddball pegged as a KGB agent way back in the 1980s, and given Shamir’s pro-Moscow rants to the present day there seems no reason to doubt he’s still friendly with Russian special services.<br>Since Assange hasn’t exactly been shy about his pro-Moscow views—including having his own show on RT, the Kremlin agitprop network—why Western reporters haven’t been digging into this mess until about four days ago is an important question. Especially since Assange years ago dropped any pretense of objectivity, slavishly following the Moscow line on a wide array of issues such as Syria which have nothing to do with

Wikileaks should be treated as the front and cut-out for Russian intelligence that it has become, while those who get in bed with Wikileaks—many Western ‘privacy advocates’ are in that group—should be asked their feelings about their own at least indirect ties with Putin’s spy services.” It’s better to see the Western media get there late rather than never.<br>There’s nothing new about Wikileaks or its key role in the Kremlin’s international propaganda apparatus. Back in 1978 the magazine Covert Action Information Bulletin appeared to expose the secrets of Western intelligence. Its editor was Phil Agee, a disgruntled former CIA officer who had gotten into bed with Cuban and Soviet intelligence (his KGB covername was PONT). CAIB was in fact founded on the direction of the KGB and for years served as a conduit for Kremlin lies and disinformation that seriously harmed Western intelligence.<br>While CAIB presented itself to the public as a truth-telling group of “whistleblowers,” in actuality it was a KGB front, though few magazine staffers beyond Agee knew who was really calling the shots and paying the bills. It’s best to think of Wkilieaks as no more than CAIB updated for the Internet age. Since senior Kremlin security officials have recently admitted that Snowden is their agent, and has shared American secrets with them, Ed is merely today’s Phil Agee—though Phil at least had the sense to defect to sunny Havana rather than snowy Moscow.<br>The important part of this story is that Russian intelligence, using its Wikileaks cut-out, has intervened directly in an American presidential election. This was something even the KGB was sheepish about doing at the height of the Cold War, but Putin fears nothing in Obama’s Washington, as his increasingly brazen actions against Americans plainly illustrate.<br>The most damaging aspect to the DNC leak is the certainty that Moscow has placed disinformation—that is, false information hidden among facts—to harm the Democrats and the Clinton campaign. Disinformation is a venerable Russian spy trick that can be politically devastating to its target.<br>Disinformation is most effective when it plays upon essential truths. Since Hillary really is corrupt and less than honest, and the DNC actually has done her bidding in shady ways, lies that amplify those themes will be readily believed by many Americans. It’s obvious that Moscow prefers Trump over Clinton in this election, which ought not surprise given the important role of Putin-friendly advisors in the Trump campaign, and what better way to help is there than to discredit Team Clinton?<br>It’s apparent already that some of the most salacious emails in the DNC mega-dump are fake—as is to be expected. It’s normal Russian spycraft to place juicy fake messages among a lot of genuine ones. Here we need rigorous independent analysis of this latest Wikileaks operation to assess what’s real and what’s made up by somebody in Moscow.<br>I’m anything but a Hillary fan, as my extensive reporting on her crimes and lies in EmailGate can attest. However, I am far more troubled by the naked interference of the Kremlin and its spy agencies in American democracy, which is a threat to our freedoms beyond anything the Clintons might do. Every American should demand thorough investigation of the DNC leak and it’s well past time for the mainstream media to examine closely what Wikileaks really is—as I’ve been doing for years. It’s satisfying to see my reality-based counterintelligence analysis of Wikileaks finally being endorsed by the media, but I would have preferred if they had paid attention earlier and the current election-year disaster with DNC emails had been avoided.<br>Disclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, the publisher of Observer Media.<br>John Schindler is a security expert and former National Security Agency analyst and counterintelligence officer.

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">Another round of protests is scheduled for Russia on Saturday, raising the question of whether a “color revolution,” this one characterized by the demonstrators’ white ribbons, capable of toppling the government is in the cards. Media attention invariably focuses on mass demonstrations, banner-waving crowds and Twitter-savvy organizers, yet what happens behind the scenes is usually much more important to the outcome of such movements. Protests are not enough, and for all the color revolutions that succeeded over the past decade -- in Serbia, Georgia and Ukraine -- there were also some glaring failures, as in Azerbaijan and Belarus.<br>While Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and other Russian government officials have darkly warned about Western efforts to fund protest movements, the reality, as events in Egypt have shown over the past year, is that outside assistance has an impact only at the margins. For a major political shift to take place in Russia over the next several months, several preconditions must be in place.<br>The first is a split in the ruling elite that can no longer be resolved internally. Sometimes it might revolve around questions of succession, which was a critical element in setting the stage for Ukraine’s Orange Revolution in 2004. It might concern deeper political and ideological questions, such as moving ahead with economic reforms or opening up the political system. It might be much more basic and crass, involving how to divide the spoils of political privilege. Whatever the motivation, if some of the powerbrokers no longer trust the existing system to protect their interests, they have a major incentive to leverage an outside source of pressure to come out on top. The leaders who drove Georgia’s “Rose Revolution”, for instance, were not outsiders, but disaffected insiders of Eduard Shevarnadze’s system.</div>

 for a society in which many people hold grievances against an abusive regime. Attempts to address these grievances in the course of daily life are likely to entail high costs coupled with very low chances of success in any meaningful sense; consequently, most citizens will choose not to challenge the regime, thus reflecting the now well-known collective action problem.<br>When a regime commits electoral fraud, however, an individual’s calculus regarding whether to participate in a protest against the regime can be changed significantly. If everyone chooses to protest simultaneously, then the costs of protest to any one individual can be dramatically lowered. Electoral fraud – when it is publicised – can therefore be a signal to aggrieved citizens that other citizens are going to join in protest now. Add social media to the mix, and you suddenly have a situation where lots of citizens who previously wanted to oppose the regime suddenly have a situation where they think they can. Moreover, electoral fraud is especially valuable signal precisely because it increases the potential benefits from protest as well: If you

:<br>Protests over fraud may be less about fraud than the fact that the election result revealed the weakness of the regime. Most of the protests seem centred around the regime cheating, but the regime has been cheating for a long time. What has changed is that they did less well in the election, signaling weakness and potentially lowering the costs or increasing the benefits to protest. So the fact that protesters think fraud was committed matters, but only in the sense that it means for a fixed reported election result, increasing beliefs about how much fraud was committed makes observers thing the regime was weaker or less popular.<br>Sign up for Al Jazeera Americas Coverage Newsletter US politics, Canada’s multiculturalism, South America’s geopolitical rise—we bring you the stories that matter.

). In a 2006 Journal of Politics article, Princeton University professor Adam Meirowitz and I present a formal theory showing that in some instances it is rational for citizens – when confronting a sequence of two elections where the first election was for a weaker office than the second election – to vote strategically and use their vote in the first election to

 to a candidate running in the second election, by casting their vote in the first election for a less preferred party.<br>The content of this message is essentially that the candidate running in the second election should shape up and perform better, and thus does not necessarily signal a genuine preference for that candidate in the second election to lose.<br>How does this apply to the 2011 Russian Duma elections? The Duma is a weak institution in comparison with the position of the President of Russia, for which elections will be held in a few months. Thus, our model suggests that it is possible that many people who voted against Putin’s party – United Russia – in the Duma elections did so in order to send a signal to Putin that they wanted him to shape up. This may have meant they wanted less corruption, less of a free rein for the current ruling elite, or more attention paid to the needs of ordinary citizens.<br>However, it would not necessarily mean they wanted the end of Putinism or for Putin himself to exit the political scene. If this interpretation of the vote is correct, then it would suggest that should Putin spend the next few months

 to the signal and showing the voters he has heard their message, it would not be surprising to see many return to Putin’s camp in the presidential election. Unfortunately from the point of view of an analyst, such a result – more votes for Putin in the presidential election than United Russia received in the parliamentary elections – would be observationally indistinguishable from a decision by the Kremlin to increase the amount of fraud in the presidential election, which is also a distinct possibility in the Russian case.<br>Only time will tell which – if either – of these interpretations of the 2011 Russian Duma elections and their aftermath is correct, but the implications for Russian politics may be large. In closing, let me suggest the possibility that they both may be correct. It is possible that the protesters – and those that will take to the streets in coming days – do indeed represent aggrieved citizens who have finally found a circumstance in which it is rational to express their grievances. And there may be many, many more of them out there in Russia.<br>But there may also be a large number of unseen Russian citizens who were not out in the street on Saturday that may have wanted little more than a wake-up call for Putin to do a better job in his next term in office. The long-term goals of these two different groups of citizens may not be the same, and how these differences are resolved may have an important impact on Russia’s future.<br>Joshua A.

 under the foundations of the Soviet Union by nationality policies that allowed non-Russians the right to secede.<br>Putin’s comments might seem like a matter of arcane history, but they’re not: They’re part of a debate over the legacy of Lenin’s revolution, which is itself actually about an unexpected challenger to Putin’s government today: the Communist Party.<br>Next year is the 100th anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that brought Lenin to power. The Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF) wants to see the anniversary celebrated.<br>More to the point, this year sees parliamentary elections, and the Communists seem to be mounting their first serious challenge since Putin came to power in 1999. This reflects some fascinating changes in the Communist Party’s grassroots, potentially remaking it into a real opposition party — and one that, while it has no hopes of another revolution, could pressure Putin’s government to make some important changes.<br>Through the Putin era, the KPRF has been content to be the fake opposition, playing its part in a political soap opera without any serious effort to actually challenge the Kremlin.<br>But in a sign of the growing divisions within the Russian elite and the rise of a new political generation, the KPRF is now becoming more outspoken and critical. Whether Putin was firing back in his comments against Lenin or simply made a blunder that fired up the party base, it certainly helped break the old accommodation.<br>This September, Russia will hold national elections to the State Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian legislature. We know Putin’s United Russia bloc and its allies will win a majority — one way or another, not least with some judicious vote rigging, the Kremlin will make sure of that.<br>But this is not the point. In Russia’s present pseudo-democracy, elections are not to decide who will run the country; they are a legitimating ritual, a chance to prove that the country is happy, confident, and behind the Kremlin. At a time when economic crisis and political drift are increasing popular discontent, this electoral legitimation is going to be all the more important — and all the more difficult.<br>By beginning to talk about the real issues facing the Russian people, the Communists may begin to reshape the national conversation<br>In 2011, obvious manipulation of that year’s Duma elections led to the so-called &quot;Bolotnaya protests&quot; and the largest anti-government rallies since Soviet times. So it will be important to the regime that it manages to get out enough voters, and enough Kremlin supporters, to make the eventual results seem at least semi-plausible.<br>This means the elections matter, even if the composition of the next Duma is not really in doubt. The more the government has to use propaganda, payout, promises, and muscle to get the votes it needs, the weaker it will look — and the more dissatisfied the elite will be with Putin’s leadership.<br>So it is hardly coincidental that the hitherto-torpid KPRF is suddenly beginning to look like a real opposition party again.<br>The talking points for KPRF campaigners, which in the past have been so blandly anodyne as to be almost parodies, confining themselves to softball issues such as more support for pensioners and war veterans, are much more hard-hitting this time. They are now encouraging canvassers to highlight government corruption and incompetence, two issues most Russians have directly experienced.<br>Meanwhile, Communist parliamentarians — who hold 92 of the Duma’s 450 seats — see corruption as a key issue to connect with the voters and have been proposing new anti-corruption measures.<br>One was a bill to ban anyone convicted of corruption offenses from ever working in government service. After all, what usually happens if anyone senior is caught is that he is found a comfortable sinecure after a token time in the wilderness. Former Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov, for example, was sacked in 2012 amid allegations that he was involved in a $100 million embezzlement case. Three years later, he quietly took up a position as a director at the state-owned Rostec corporation.<br>Another bill called for families of senior officials to be barred from working in business connected with the officials’ work: a normal exclusion in many countries but, again, something new for Russia.<br>These bills will not ever become laws; there are too many vested interests at stake for that. But in many ways, that’s not the point. Simply by proposing them, the Communists are challenging the status quo and positioning themselves as the anti-corruption party.<br>Given the extent to which corruption is at the heart of the political system Putin has built, that is indeed a serious challenge.<br>It is hard to believe that all this new militancy could be coming from the KPRF’s veteran leader, Gennady Zyuganov. The heavyset 71-year-old lost out to Boris Yeltsin in the 1996 presidential elections, at least in part, almost certainly, due to electoral fraud. Since then, he seems to have accepted his role as tame opposition leader. Although he is willing to speak out against Putin, in practice he and his Duma deputies have tended to side with the government at every crucial juncture.<br>Rather, this new approach is likely to have been forced on Zyuganov by his party’s grassroots. The base of the KPRF has been a rump of aging Soviet veterans. Many hold deeply regressive, even Stalinist views, but nonetheless tend to be formidable and committed. Thanks to them, the party has managed to retain the only national political machine that is not controlled by the Kremlin.<br>However, scattered and anecdotal accounts, especially from Russia’s regions, suggest there is a new generation of Communist Party members, disgruntled 20- and 30-somethings, for whom it offers the only structure able to articulate any kind of opposition politics.<br>They are generally not Soviet-style communists, actually being closer to European social democrats. Rather than a violent seizure of power and the liquidation of the kulaks, they want progressive taxation and a narrower gap between rich and poor.<br>Ironic as it may be, the Communists may be about to help advance the cause of democracy and reform in Russia<br>In the USA, these young grassroots members might be canvassing for Bernie Sanders, but in Russia they are beginning to push the KPRF to address the issues affecting their day-to-day lives: worsening public services, exploitative and inefficient local administrations, corruption from the top to the bottom of the system.<br>

<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">The Biden administration has formulated an unprecedented response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The coordination of transatlantic diplomacy, including the condemnation of Russia at the United Nations and the implementation of a massive sanctions package, is truly impressive. The president’s recent request for an additional $33 billion from Congress in security, economic, and humanitarian aid for Ukraine demonstrates the seriousness of America’s commitment to European security.<br>While the White House should be applauded for its response to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, this only tells part of the story. Indeed, none of these diplomatic initiatives would have been necessary had the United States and its allies successfully deterred Russia from attacking Ukraine in the first place. Deterrence failed because the United States and its allies signaled, in advance, that it was not prepared to apply direct military force in Ukraine. It did so because it was afraid of Vladimir Putin’s nuclear threats. America’s risk calculus was framed by the fear of nuclear escalation and Washington’s overestimation of Russian military power.<br>While initial efforts to deter Russia have failed, the West should now pursue a different approach. Rather than deterrence, the United States should focus on compellence. A comprehensive compellence strategy toward Russia would entail the focused integration of covert and overt military power, as well as a greater efforts to conduct information operations inside Russia to weaken Putin’s fragile political control.<br>The goal of such a strategy could be to force Putin to stop the war, not merely help Ukraine stave off defeat. It strives to achieve this by raising costs to Moscow beyond sanctions and political isolation. The strategy would help the West coalesce around the objective of ending the war in the near term, but also forcing a negotiated conclusion to hostilities that would be more advantageous to Ukrainian and Western interests. The West’s aim should be to ensure Putin suffers an operational failure, not accede to Russia’s subjugation of Ukraine or some tortured negotiated compromise.<br>The Need for Compellence<br>Ukraine has, thus far, been brilliant in asymmetric tactics with creative applications of modern tools of warfare. Nevertheless, Russian forces have destroyed much of Ukraine’s infrastructure, while roughly 25 percent of the nation’s population is displaced and hungry. Without support from the United States and the West, Ukraine may still be unable to prevent Russia from achieving its new goals, which likely include seizing the entire southern coast of Ukraine, including Odessa.<br>With the opening of the new phase of the war in Donbas and the Black Sea coastline, both sides of the conflict are now engaged in a race of strategic and operational adaptation. The coming battles will be on different terrain, and require altered tactics and weapons than the initial fighting around Kyiv. This will be a very different battlefield and the results are not preordained. Which side learns faster and altered its strategy and force employment best will determine the course of this war in the second phase.<br>The Elements of Comprehensive Compellence<br>One month before the war started, FPRI’s Rob Lee argued that Moscow’s compellence strategy would include the use of military force directly against Kyiv or more likely by punitive raids deep into the eastern half of Ukraine.

 Despite Ukraine’s successful effort to turn back Russian forces around Kyiv, Russia’s compellence strategy has not yet failed. As a result, it needs to be undercut by NATO with a more comprehensive approach.<br>A robust U.S. counter to Moscow, what might be called comprehensive compellence, would build on the administration’s defense strategy concept of integrated deterrence to get Putin to alter his misguided effort in Ukraine. Compellence is normally a harder task historically than deterrence, but given Russia’s dysfunctional military effectiveness, the cost-benefit analysis for compellence in this case augurs for success.<br>Deterrence and compellence share some common elements but are conceptually distinct. Deterrence seeks to persuade an adversary to not to take some action that it is capable of. On the other hand, compellence is an effort to persuade the opponent to stop some behavior or change its course due to the threat of coercive force or via incentives. Compellence is often needed in the wake of deterrence failure.<br>While America’s efforts to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine failed, a compellence strategy would have a greater chance of success. After Russia’s inept military campaign and Ukraine’s effective resistance, the balance of power now favors the United States and its allies. Russian losses on the battlefield and degraded economic strength due to sanctions make the military components of a Western compellence strategy even more credible.<br>A strategy of comprehensive compellence in support of Ukraine would have five elements or lines of effort.<br>Diplomatic and political<br>This element is already being aggressively pursued by the Biden administration in its political and economic isolation of Russia and its leaders. It has successfully made Putin a pariah in most circles, although China, India, and some other states are taking a different approach. The European Union and NATO have been energized and coordinated brilliantly. Efforts similar to the removal of Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council should be pursued, including the forthcoming G20 meeting this year. In any event, after a year or two of sanctions, Russia may be functionally dismissed from the G20 entirely depending upon the price of oil and natural gas.<br>In terms of a new initiative, Finland and Sweden should be offered swift approval of their applications for membership in NATO. While their applications are under consideration by NATO’s 30 member states, the United Kingdom and United States should offer Finland and Sweden immediate security guarantees to protect them from Russian threats. The application process has historically taken over a year, and Russia will undoubtedly apply coercive pressure against the applicants. Additionally, former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb should be made a NATO official with a chance to become the next secretary general when Jens Stoltenberg’s term ends in 2023. The North Atlantic Council might consider Amb. (ret.) Ivo Daldler’s proposal to admit Ukraine now. However, this would be resisted by key NATO members, and should be left to the final negotiations.<br>Informational<br>The ongoing war has stressed the importance of strategic communications, and Zelensky has proven to be extremely effective in the battle of narratives.<br>Moscow has employed its usual playbook of disinformation and propaganda, but to little discernable effect in Europe and North America. Russia continues to apply its concept of information confrontation against NATO and Ukraine. It persistently seeks to exploit identified vulnerabilities of democratic societies using cyber and information operations. Russia’s goal is to exacerbate existing societal, political, and military divisions. Key targets of this approach are the legitimacy of Ukraine’s government and NATO cohesion. Putin has been outdone by the determined and savvy Zelenskyy in this dimension of the conflict. However, Putin’s efforts gain more purchase in China, in democratic states like India, and parts of Africa.<br>Efforts to pierce the fog of disinformation inside Russia should be intensified. There are few sources for independent news inside the country, but a few techniques seem to still be working. Ukraine has taken a macabre approach with facial recognition technology to identify and contact the families of fallen Russian soldiers to inform them of the fate of their loved one. They have also constructed websites for families to gain information on the status of their family members fighting against Ukraine, and at the same time receive some perspective on the scale of the war that Moscow hides from its own citizens. In Kyiv, the Information Strategies Council of Ukraine, a coalition of activists and think tanks, sent emails and social media messages directly to 15 million Russian men of draft age. It has also targeted older Russians with different tailored messages, using historical references to stimulate a questioning of Moscow-generated news reports and propaganda.<br>Other methods to project factual narratives to more Russians from Russians outside the Kremlin’s control would probably be more effective. NATO and the European Union need to create the capacity to design and conduct an information offensive into Russia and overwhelm Putin’s control of information. Putin seems to be afraid of

 It may be a model to build upon, but it will take a collective effort from European states to establish an ability to project truth into Russia, and penetrate Putin’s dominance of his domestic information ecosystem.<br>Russian cyber attacks against Ukraine have not been effective so far. However, Russian intelligence, particularly the GRU-supported Sandworm team, are persistently threatening Ukraine’s electricity generation capacity and its power grid. The Zelensky government is facing an ongoing surge in cyber activity at present. The West can do more to support the Ukrainians in this battlespace with both technical and intelligence support to ensure that their critical infrastructure is preserved and functional. The Ukrainians seem to be holding their own despite Russia’s presumed cyber dominance.<br>Military<br>The principal military stick in this strategy is supplied by the Ukrainians themselves, abetted by Western arms. This will have to be both accelerated and sustained during the next phase which is likely to involve intensive artillery and missile consumption. It will also require mass quantities of supplies, and enough drones to supplement the limited assets now flown by the Ukrainians. Recently, aid was increased by another increment. This new tranche of $800 million sounds enormous and the material is being delivered at an unprecedented timeline. Even with the recent presidential request of $33 billion in aid from Congress, it may be both inadequate and too late.<br>More covert but direct kinetic means will be necessary as this is a war of considerable attrition. Indirect modes of conflict via proxy forces are nothing new (e.g., El Salvador, Angola, and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon). The use of proxy forces has a long history but also a growing salience in an era of strategic competition. One of the evolving modes of warfare that is suited for comprehensive compellence is

 In this mode of warfare, state’s avoid the use of their own soldiers as the primary bearer of warfare’s grave costs, and delegate it to proxy forces and the use of remotely fielded technological surrogates to better enable the state to manage the risks of modern conflict. They may also employ paramilitary forces for intelligence support for targeting critical nodes of the attacking force. For this conflict, this would mean the a greater use of allied tools for cyber warfare, greater intelligence sharing, and more unmanned precision strikes on key Russian operational centers and critical supply links inside Ukraine.<br>Finally, NATO’s posture has been prudently enhanced with the deployment of four new NATO battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. More needs to be done to prepare for cross-border contingencies. NATO should posture one or two division-plus sized forces outside Ukraine in case peacekeeping or armed humanitarian intervention is needed. One can anticipate that human security and disaster relief operations may be needed in short order given the scale of the destruction of Ukrainian energy, medical, and water supplies.<br>Economic<br>America and its allies have implemented a massive sanctions package against Russia. As a result, Russian finances may soon be in default and its economy could nosedive. More attention should be paid to Russia’s energy exports. As

 Since there is little support in some capitals for more intensive sanctions, there may be value in defining their duration and the conditions for tempering them.<br>Some have proposed that the West continue sanctions for as long as Putin remains in power. In essence, this is a call for regime change. Such a threat may not achieve much in real terms but it carries some risk since it directly challenges the Kremlin’s principal power center. It is highly unlikely to be accepted by German or French leaders. A more strategic approach would be to keep sanctions remain in place until Russian forces have departed all agreed territories and military commanders are turned in to appropriate authorities.<br>Comprehensive compellence should also include funding for Ukraine’s restoration. The Economist estimates the reconstruction tab for Ukraine at $200–520 billion. As some scholars have recently written, rather than simply freeze Russia’s hard currency reserves in Western banks, those currency reserves should be liquidated and put to use. These assets should be collected and transferred to the International Criminal Court in escrow for reparations.<br>The West should start proceedings to allot reparations to Kyiv from those funds. This would communicate to the Russian leadership that every day of destruction in Ukraine is simply another day of reconstruction in its future, which Moscow will pay for. Ideally, this might induce them to stop attacking and terrorizing civilians and operate within the law of armed conflict.<br>Legal<br>The West should purse indictments at the International Criminal Court for each division and Army commander whose area of responsibility is shown to have committed crimes against humanity and other violations of international law. Washington should also do the same for corporate and unit leaders of the Wagner Group, the mercenaries purportedly behind the Bucha massacre. Judicial proceedings may be far off, but the intent to prosecute needs to be clear now.<br>Now Is the Time for Compellence<br>The U.S. government should build on the opportunities that Ukraine’s tenacious defense has created, but with greater urgency and more force. Putin understands force, not nuance or the incremental allotments of weapons the West is providing. The initial strategy from the United States and its allies has been applied slowly and incrementally, and not as coherently messaged as a strategy of compellence. It has not forced Putin to recalculate expected benefits and evident costs. To date, the United States is reacting, and putting the onus of fighting all on the Ukrainians. NATO is explicitly not well postured to inject any significant combat power or humanitarian aid, it is only postured to defend NATO’s frontier and airspace.<br>The West needs to craft a comprehensive strategy with the explicit goal of compelling Putin to stop his aggression, not just merely keep Ukraine at the survival level. To date, U.S. statecraft has helped Ukraine buy time, but it has to be expanded to include the marshalling of greater military power in collaboration with its key allies. Ukraine can still be saved from protracted devastation, mass casualties, and an ignoble capitulation that merely extends Putin’s influence and weakens Europe. Russia can be compelled to limit its objectives and to stop its egregious violations of international law and return to diplomacy. It may be time for the United States and its democratic states to take Biden’s impressive speech in Warsaw to heart, and
